excerpt: "New API to manage product availability and delivery promises for sellers"
---

The new [Delivery Promise Notification API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/delivery-promise-notification-api) (Beta) enables sellers to provide real-time product availability and delivery information to VTEX stores. With this API, sellers can notify stores of updates to product availability, helping ensure that shoppers only see products available for their specific location—based on both inventory status and applicable shipping methods.

>ℹ️ This feature is currently in beta testing. We welcome feedback and questions through our [Support Center](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests).

The Delivery Promise Notification API includes the following endpoint:

- `PUT` [Update product availability](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/delivery-promise-notification-api#put-/delivery-promises/external-sellers/-sellerId-/products)

For implementation details, refer to the [Delivery Promise](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/delivery-promise-beta--p9EJH9GgxL0JceA6dBswd) documentation.
