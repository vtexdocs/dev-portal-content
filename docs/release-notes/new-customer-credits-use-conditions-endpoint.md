Each Customer Credit account has a set of use conditions configured specifically for it.

With that, the Checkout displays a personalized scenario every time that a client chooses the Customer Credit as a payment method to make a purchase.

Now, using [this new endpoint](link), you can retrieve an account's use conditions all at once. In addition to the payment conditions, the payload also retrieves the quantity of available credit and the account identifier.
