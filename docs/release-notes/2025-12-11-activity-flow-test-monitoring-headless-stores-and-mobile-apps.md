We expanded [**Activity Flow**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/activity-flow) to reliably track shopper behavior and performance across headless storefronts and mobile apps (Flutter and React Native), in addition to VTEX native storefronts.

## What has changed?

Previously, Activity Flow was enabled by default only for VTEX native storefront solutions (FastStore, Store Framework, and Legacy CMS Portal).

Now, you can install Activity Flow in headless stores and mobile apps built with Flutter or React Native.

## Why did we make this change?

By extending Activity Flow beyond VTEX native storefronts, we ensure consistent, real user data collection across web and mobile channels. This extension provides insights into traffic, engagement, and performance across your channels.

## What needs to be done?
