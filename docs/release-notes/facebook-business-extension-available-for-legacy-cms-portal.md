[Facebook Business Extension (FBE)](https://developers.facebook.com/products/business-apps/?locale=en_US) is an app that provides a streamlined way to integrate with Facebook services and features. The integration offers different features, including:

1. **Facebook Pixel:** Facebook Pixel allows you to measure the effectiveness of your business advertising by analyzing the actions users take on your website.
2. **Conversions API:** The Conversions API is designed to create a direct connection between your marketing data and the Facebook system.

We have updated our published documentation so stores using our Legacy CMS Portal can learn how to set up the FBE app, allowing stores that use the Legacy CMS Portal to enjoy the benefits offered by them. This requires manual configuration on the frontend and on the backend.

Stores using VTEX IO were not affected by this update, and can follow the instructions in our [documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-facebook-fbe) to integrate with FBE.

If your store uses Legacy CMS Portal and you want to use the features of the FBE app, follow the instructions in:
