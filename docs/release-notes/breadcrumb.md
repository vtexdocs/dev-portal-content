The Breadcrumb component gained a series of key improvements, such as:

- Two new **CSS Handles** (`homeLink` and `termArrow`).
- **Variations to the already existing Handles** `link` and `arrow`, so that users can individually and independently customize each one.
- Two **new props** (`homeIconSize` and `caretIconSize`).
- In addition, all Handles pertaining to the component now make use of the [**new CSS Handles creation format**](release). 

## Main advantages

Should I say more? The new props responsible for controlling the height and width values of Breadcrumb icons and all CSS Handle improvements make the component even **more flexible** to the customization wishes of the retailer.

## What you need to do

In order for your [**Breadcrumb**](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.breadcrumb) to be fully stocked with the above-mentioned features, ensure that it's running version **1.8.0** or higher.
