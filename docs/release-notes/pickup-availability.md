In the Product Page, the new Pickup Availability component shows the availability of a product in a brick-and-mortar store's inventory selected by the user.

> ⚠️ When selecting a brick-and-mortar store and buying the product afterwards, Pickup Availability does not reserve that product for the user. It only shows the product's availability itself in the chosen store. 

## Main advantages 

The new component is a fundamental tool for strengthening **Omnichannel** experience in your business, allowing users to overcome barriers between brick-and-mortar and online stores.
