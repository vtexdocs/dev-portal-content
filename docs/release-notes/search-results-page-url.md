All Search Results pages, whether custom or not, can now **keep their path unaltered** even when users apply filters.

## What has changed

The Filter Navigator's `preventRouteChange` prop makes it possible to keep page customizations even when new filters are applied on the page, merely changing the URLâ€™s query string instead of the entire URL.

The problem was that until this release, [only custom pages](https://vtex.io/docs/releases/2019-week-32-33/custom-pages-url) paths were exempt from undergoing additional changes when filtered by a user. 

Now, in addition to working on custom pages, this prop can also be applied on non-customized search result pages.

_Notice that only the search results were reloaded, the page structure remained intact_.

## Main Advantages 

Theis release **prevents a full page reload** for every time that filters are applied, thereby **improving loading time and rendering** for users.

## What you need to do

This improvement is available starting with the [**Search Result**](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.search-result) app version **3.35.5** . Make sure that your store is already running this version or a higher one.
