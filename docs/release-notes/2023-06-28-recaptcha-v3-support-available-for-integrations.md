excerpt: "You can now integrate with reCAPTCHA v3 using the Checkout API."
---

If you use Checkout API to build your own headless/mobile storefront or order placement integration, you can now integrate with [reCAPTCHA v3](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3). This is a recommended update for native mobile apps, providing a real user validation layer to them that is already available for native VTEX storefronts.

>ℹ️ If you use a native VTEX storefronts or already integrate with reCAPTCHA v2 via the Checkout API, no action is required. reCAPTCHA will continue working as configured.

To learn more about how to use reCAPTCHA v3 in your native mobile app, check out the [Implementing reCAPTCHA in integrations](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/recaptcha) guide. You can find more information about this technology in the [reCAPTCHA documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro).
