The Multiple page templates feature enhances the capabilities of FastStore with Headless CMS, allowing you to create and manage flexible layouts for Product Details Pages (PDPs) and Product Listing Pages (PLPs). These templates enable customization based on product information, user context, product type, brand specifications, and template hierarchy.

>⚠️ This feature is already included in stores using the 3.0.18 `@faststore/core` package version.

## What has changed?

Previously, Headless CMS had limitations in customizing page layouts for PDPs and PLPs. With the introduction of Multiple page templates, you can now create distinct templates tailored to different products or categories within your store. This feature enhances the flexibility and customization options for designing engaging and dynamic storefront experiences.

## Why are we making this change?

By empowering users to create and manage hierarchical templates, we aim to provide greater flexibility in designing storefronts that meet specific branding and user experience requirements.

## What needs to be done?

To benefit from this feature, check the [Multiple page templates](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-multiple-page-template
) guide for implementation details.
