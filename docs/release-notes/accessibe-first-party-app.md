> ℹ️ accessiBe is an automated web accessibility solution that analyzes websites to ensure their compliance and accessibility regardless of any updates these undergo.

## Main advantages

The native app ensures that retailers integrates their store with the accessiBe solution in a better, faster and easier way.

> ⚠️ **Installing the accessiBe app in your store does not automatically contract its services**, but merely provides a native integration together with a third party service. The app’s installation is therefore only recommended to those that already use this solution in their store.

## What you need to do

1. Open the **VTEX App Store** and install the accessiBe app on your store.

2. Access [**accessiBe’s website**](https://accessibe.com/), login with your account and then add your VTEX store URL to  my websites  in the  Manage Websites  tab.
