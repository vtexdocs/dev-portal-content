New CSS Handles were added to the [Search Result app](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.search-result/) to enable the Filter Navigator component customization on mobile devices. Namely:

- `accordionFilterContainer`         
- `accordionFilterContent` 
- `filterBreadcrumbsContent` 
- `filterBreadcrumbsText`

:sparkles: We would not be able to deliver this amazing result if it was not for [Beatriz Miranda](https://github.com/BeatrizMiranda) from ACCT! Our sincere thanks, Beatriz!
