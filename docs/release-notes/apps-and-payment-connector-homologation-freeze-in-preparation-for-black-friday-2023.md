A homologation freeze is a behavior adopted by VTEX in the period before Black Friday to ensure that our platform no longer performs updates, entering a security mode, which allows greater resilience, reliability, and stability for our customers' businesses.

## How is the freeze done?

We will have a deadline for receiving requests for approval and publication of apps in the App Store and payment connectors in our gateway. Therefore, tickets opened after the deadline will be queued for publishing and updating but will not be updated before Black Friday, November 24, 2023. After Cyber Monday week, our team will resume its regular schedule with periodic request updates.

>⚠️ The homologation freeze period is also valid for tickets requesting updates to connectors or connectors templates at checkout.

## Homologation security schedule

The homologation freeze dates are:

- Deadline to receive tickets for homologation before Black Friday: October 10, 2023
- Deadline for homologation: November 10, 2023
- Normal homologation process resumes: December 4, 2023

## Additional information

The commitment to homologate apps and payment connectors is only valid for official VTEX partners and their specific operating regions.

If the homologation sent within the deadline needs to be changed or fixed by the partner, this adjustment must also be made respecting the limit of our freeze schedule presented above regarding **the homologation deadline** on November 10, 2023.
