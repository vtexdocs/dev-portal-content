Some VTEX IO native components received their own CSS Handles to facilitate customization by CSS classes. 

CSS Handles are **HTML element identifiers**. Therefore, these can be used to simply customize your store components by simply using CSS classes throughout the Store Theme's code.

## Main advantages 

**CSS Handles are simply layout building assistants**. Without them, the layout building depends on CSS Selectors, which look to a page's HTML hierarchy when selecting an element for your specific customization.

This store customization practice, in addition to being vulnerable, will soon be deprecated. Therefore, this improvement is **very advantageous**. More of your store's components can now be customized by CSS classes in a simple way through the use of CSS Handles.

## What you need to do

**No action** for this release is warranted on your side. This improvement is already available to all VTEX IO native components users.
