The number of rendered components by React can be reduced using hooks, which allows for a better React render performance.

> This improvement is more noticeable in pages that have lots of extensions.

## What has changed

Previously, all components necessary for rendering each page were added to the React tree among a `ContextConsumer`, increasing rendering time.

At present, by using the hooks React feature in VTEX IO `render-runtime`, you can reuse a `ContextConsumer` component data by directly using the `context` object in the component itself, without adding it to the React tree. This ensures a faster loading time for the end user.

This improvement can lead to improvements in responsiveness of up to 30%!

##  Main advantages

By adopting the new hooks React functionality, React will spend less time rendering components onto the interface, thereby ensuring a faster and better end user response time in both stores and admin.

## What do you need to do

This improvement is available to any user that has [Store](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store) app version 2.x installed,   since any such store automatically uses render-runtime version 8.x (in which this improvement was implemented). 

## Side effects

There should be none.
