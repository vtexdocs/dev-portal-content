Starting on July 1st, 2023, Google Analytics 4 (GA4) will become Google's official data analysis tool, replacing the current version, Universal Analytics (UA). According to [Google's official announcement](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528), this change requires stores to migrate their UA property settings to GA4 before July 1st to continue tracking data navigation.

To assist with this migration, Store Framework stores can benefit from the new VTEX Google Tag Manager (GTM) app version. The app allows stores to send events in the GA4 format while still sending UA events, facilitating a smooth transition to GA4.

> ⚠️ If you have a store using Legacy CMS Portal, refer to the [Help Center announcement](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/upgrade-your-store-to-google-analytics-4--01mmrSck8nvXAKsypecT9V).

## What has changed?

As of July 1st, 2023, Google Analytics 4 (GA4) will be the only operational version of the tool, as the processing of events by Universal Analytics will be discontinued. Therefore, VTEX users are strongly encouraged to transition to GA4 to continue receiving valuable analytical insights for their stores.

To aid in this transition, VTEX has released a new Google Tag Manager (GTM) version capable of sending events in both UA and GA4 formats. To activate this, it is necessary to enable the new **Send Google Analytics 4 Events** setting on the app's Admin and configure some GA4 tags on GTM.

## Why are we making this change?

- Migrate from the Universal Analytics property settings to Google Analytics 4.
- Keep your store compatible with Google Analytics 4.
- Obtain relevant data on navigation through the most current version of the Google tool.

## What needs to be done?

Refer to the [Installing Google Tag Manager](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-google-tag-manager) and the [Setting up Google Tag Manager](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-setting-up-google-tag-manager) to configure the Google Analytics 4 settings.
