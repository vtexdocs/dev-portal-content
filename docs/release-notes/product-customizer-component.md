The new Product Customizer component allows a product's attachments to be defined by the user in the Product Details Page.

> ℹ️ An attachment is the optional and cost-free customization of a product. It's used to add information to an SKU, such as choosing the name which should appear on the back of a soccer shirt.

## What has changed

Before this component, a product's attachments were hidden from the interface, meaning users could not see existing customization options for the product they're buying. 

## Main advantages

There are few things more frustrating than enriching a store's product with attachments and not have these made available to users. The new component gives a store's product attachments **visibility** :tada: 

## What you need to do

Better understand how your store's new block and its functionalities work by accessing its [documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/components/product/vtex.product-customizer).
