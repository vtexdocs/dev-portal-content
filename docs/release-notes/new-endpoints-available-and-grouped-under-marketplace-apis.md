Now you can find all marketplace endpoints under the same category: Marketplace API. We grouped the Suggestions and Notifications endpoints under a single space, so all the marketplace and seller operations are more accessible to users. 

We’ve also added a new set of endpoints to the Marketplace API. The **SKU Approval Settings** endpoints allow marketplaces to automatically approve SKUs received from sellers. These are the new endpoints available:

- [Get autoApprove Status in Account Settings](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/sku-approval-settings#get-autoapprove-value)
- [Activate autoApprove in Marketplace's Account](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/sku-approval-settings#activate-autoapprove-for-account)
- [Activate autoApprove Setting for a Seller](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/sku-approval-settings#activate-autoapprove-for-seller)
