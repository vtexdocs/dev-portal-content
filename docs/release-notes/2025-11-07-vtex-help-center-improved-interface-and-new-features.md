VTEX has launched a new [Help Center](https://newhelp.vtex.com/en) with a cleaner interface design, enhanced search, and other updates.

The goal is to improve your experience with our documentation, combining the same high-quality content with a refreshed look and a portal that offers more functionality. Some of the main improvements include:

* Modern, lightweight appearance
* New side navigation menu
* Fast and smart search
* Mobile version improvements
* New features for known issues and troubleshooting articles
* New button `Copy for AI`

For more information on these and other improvements, see the [announcement](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/2025-11-07-vtex-help-center-now-with-enhanced-interface-and-new-features) in the new Help Center.
