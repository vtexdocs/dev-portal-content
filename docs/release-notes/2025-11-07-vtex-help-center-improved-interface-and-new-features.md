VTEX has launched a new [Help Center](https://newhelp.vtex.com/en) with a cleaner interface design, enhanced search, and other updates.

* Modern, lightweight appearance
* New side navigation menu
* Fast and smart search
* Mobile version improvements
* New features for known issues and troubleshooting articles
* New button `Copy to AI`

For more information on these and other improvements, see the [announcement](XXX) in the new Help Center.
