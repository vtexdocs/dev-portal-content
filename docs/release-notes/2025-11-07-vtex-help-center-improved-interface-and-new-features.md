The goal is to improve your experience with our documentation, combining the same high-quality content with a refreshed look and a portal that offers more functionality. Some of the main improvements include:

* Modern, lightweight appearance
* New side navigation menu
* Fast and smart search
* Mobile version improvements
* New features for known issues and troubleshooting articles

For more information on these and other improvements, see the [announcement](XXX) in the new Help Center.
