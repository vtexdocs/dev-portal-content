excerpt: "The Register change on order endpoint will be deprecated."
---

On March 1, 2026, the [Register modifications on order](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api#post-/api/oms/pvt/orders/-orderId-/changes) endpoint will be deprecated. We stopped providing support for this API on December 31, 2025.

## What has changed?

The [Create order modifications](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api#patch-/api/order-system/orders/-changeOrderId-/changes) endpoint offers an improved order modification experience, allowing you to preview, retry, and cancel the changes. You can also view change details, summary, full history, and settings.

As a result, the Register modifications on order endpoint will be deactivated on March 1, 2026.
