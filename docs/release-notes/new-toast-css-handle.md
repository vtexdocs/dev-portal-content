The Toast component just received a new CSS handle, namely the `vtex-toast-container`. 

## What has changed

The Toast component, which appears when a product is added to the cart using the `BuyButton` and `ProductSummaryBuyButton`, did not have any CSS handle before this improvement.

This meant that the component could not have its own customized style. Its customization could be made according to the store's general customizations in the `style.json` folder of the store's theme code.

## Main advantages

The new CSS handle enables Toast customizations through CSS classes whenever desired, allowing the component to become **more flexible** according to your desired style. 

## What you need to do

Join in the celebrations: NOTHING needs to be done, the CSS handle is already **available**. You can start your Toast customizations right now!
