VTEX clients building new FastStore projects can now install the [FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview) directly, eliminating the need to open a ticket for VTEX Support to install it.
What needs to be done?

To install the app to your store account, follow the instructions in [Install the FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements#install-the-faststore-webops-app).
