The GTM `productView` event got a new feature, being able to also track user browsing between SKUs. 

> ℹ️ The `productView` event follows the Google Enhanced Commerce pattern and allows retailers to use it to track their users navigation through Google Analytics.

## What has changed 

Previously, the `productView` event was only triggered when users would access a product page, only allowing retailers to track what products users has seen.

This new functionality makes it possible to **track user browsing between SKU** as well. This means that whenever a user changes SKU in the Product Details Page, a new event will also be triggered.

## Main advantage 

By also tracking navigation between SKUs, the event provides retailers with **more visibility and insight on user behavior**.

## What you need to do

Nothing at all! The new event trigger is already available to everyone.
