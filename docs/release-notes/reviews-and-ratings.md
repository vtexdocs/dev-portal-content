The new Reviews and Ratings app provides a **VTEX native solution for product reviews and ratings**, including an admin interface for the management of reviews.

## What has changed   

Previously, there was no native product review and ratings solution. Stores depended exclusively on third-party solutions and first party apps developed for the integration. 

Water under the bridge. VTEX's native solution to manage these requirements is called Reviews and Ratings and it's online!

## Main advantages   

The new app is extremely **important** and **strategic**, since it **offers retailers a solution that they were asking for** and for which they previously needed to seek help outside the platform.

Now, the platform is capable of handling these business needs. 

## What you need to do   

You can find more details on the implementation and use of the **Reviews and Ratings app** by accessing its [**documentation**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.reviews-and-ratings/).
