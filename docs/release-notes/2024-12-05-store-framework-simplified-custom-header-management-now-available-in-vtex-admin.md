You can now manage headers in stores built with Store Framework directly in the VTEX Admin without contacting our support team.

## What has changed?

Previously:

- Adding or modifying headers required opening a ticket with VTEX Support.
- You could only add a single custom header.

Now:

- Fully manage headers in the VTEX Admin.
- Easily add multiple custom headers.

## What needs to be done?

To manage your store headers, follow the instructions in the guide [Adding custom headers to your Store Framework store](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/adding-custom-headers-to-your-store-framework-store).
