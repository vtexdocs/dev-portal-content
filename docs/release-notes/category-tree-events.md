Every Google Enhanced Ecommerce event used by our Tag Manager solution now sends the whole product category tree. You can use this new information in your Google Analytics.

## What has changed

In the every event's category field, we now send the full category tree, instead of the simple category.

### How it works

Example: [https://storetheme.vtex.com/apparel---accessories/hats/caps](https://storetheme.vtex.com/apparel---accessories/hats/caps)

For this product, we would send the information:

```
{
...
	category: “caps”,
...
}
```  
We now send the full category tree:

```
{
...
	category: “apparel---accessories/hats/caps”,
...
}
```

It immediately reflects upon the store's Google Analytics.

## Main advantages

The user can now undertake a better analysis of categories navigation, since the full tree is available.

## What you need to do

All the events related to the products already have the category tree info.

## Side effects

You might notice that the category structure shown in your Google Analytics has changed.
