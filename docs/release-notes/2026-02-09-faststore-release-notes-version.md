FastStore version `3.96.0` focuses on a clearer My Account order experience for B2B and more reliable data after authentication changes.

## General

**Fresher data after login/logout (PR: [#3152](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/3152))**

GraphQL requests now add a cache-busting token when the auth cookie changes. This reduces stale data right after sign-in or sign-out, so storefront content updates more consistently.

**Logout clears client storage (PR: [#3163](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/3163))**

Signing out now clears client-side storage used by session-aware features, preventing leftover data from affecting the next session.

## My Account for B2B

**Item-level taxes and totals (PR: [#3144](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/3144))**

Each item in the delivery accordion now shows its own tax amount and total, so customers can understand how taxes contribute to the final price.

**Payment surcharge visibility in the summary (PR: [#3144](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/3144))**

If a payment method includes interest or a surcharge, the Summary card now adds an `Interest` line item before the Total, so the final amount is transparent.
