VTEX IO CLI now inspects if route conflicts can occur in your workspace as a result of installing a new app.

## How it works

The inspection is automatically applied when an app is installed in a workspace using the command `vtex install`. If there is any verified route risk, the app installation is frozen.

To ignore this inspection and install the app even if when it generates route conflicts, simply type in the `-f` parameter at the end of the command, such as `vtex install -f`.

## Main advantages

In addition to stifling route conflicts in any workspace, an automated inspection also entails greater fluidity of the development process.

## What you need to do

Make sure your **VTEX IO CLI** is updated to version **2.67.0** or higher.

> ℹ️ You can run `vtex -v` to check the VTEX IO CLI version and `npm i -g vtex` or `yarn global add vtex` in order to update it.
