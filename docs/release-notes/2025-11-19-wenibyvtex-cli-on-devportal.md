To provide a unified and accessible documentation experience, we integrated the CLI documentation for Weni by VTEX into the VTEX Developers Portal.

Weni by VTEX offers post-sales support solutions powered by data, artificial intelligence, and agents, with a comprehensive platform to enhance customer experience (CX). The Weni by VTEX CLI allows you to create customized AI multi-agents, enabling developers to build, deploy, and manage AI agents with tailored tools and functionalities across various communication channels. 

### What has changed
Previously, this documentation was available through the Weni portal. However, this portal was deprecated, and the CLI documentation is only available in the VTEX Developers Portal.

Now, there's a Weni By VTEX category in our Guides, including the following articles for the CLI:
- [Using Weni by VTEX]()
- [Weni by VTEX CLI Command Reference]()
- [Authenticating with your Weni by VTEX account]()
- [Managing your Weni by VTEX projects]()
- [Understanding the core concepts]()
- [Working with agents]()
- [Fetching and filtering logs]()
- [Testing the Tool Run feature]()

### What needs to be done
To access the CLI documentation, go to [Weni by VTEX]() in the VTEX Developers Portal instead of the legacy Weni docs portal.
