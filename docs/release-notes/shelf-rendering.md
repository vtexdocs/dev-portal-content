Our Shelf component is now rendered on the Server Side, ensuring the end user benefits from a faster component loading time.

## What has changed

Previously, the Shelf component was taking too long to be rendered. Whenever you accessed a page that had a shelf, it would take much longer to show up when compared to the time it took other store components.

## Main advantage

By decreasing the Shelf component loading time, we aim to provide users with a better browsing experience.

## What you need to do

This improvement is available from version __1.20.4__ of our [Shelf component](https://github.com/vtex-apps/shelf) onward. Make sure you already have it installed!
