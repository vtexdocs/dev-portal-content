### Notable bug fixes üêõ

- [Site Editor's component list](https://github.com/vtex-apps/admin-pages/pull/268) - Previously, site-wide components were not displayed in Site Editor's component list. With this bug fix, the full list will be displayed to the user.
- [Pickup point ID](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-components/pull/577) - The Pickup point ID should not have been displayed in the Shipping Simulator as was the case. This bug fix remedies this scenario.
- [Google Tag Manager app events](https://github.com/vtex-apps/google-tag-manager/pull/25) - Events sent by the Google Tag Manager app were inconsistent with regards to the sent ID, which sometimes pertained to the SKU while other times to the product. This fix ensures that all events are now sent using SKU IDs.
