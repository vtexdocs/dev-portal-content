The Breadcrumb component’s new `showOnMobile` prop makes it available for mobile.

## What has changed

Previously, mobile users could not see Breadcrumb during their browsing. Now, the prop can set the component to either appear or not when in mobile mode by setting it to `true` or `false`, respectively.

## Main advantage

On mobile mode, users could normally face difficulties in locating themselves on pages they are browsing. Mobile users benefit from a better browsing experience with the component’s improvement, since Breadcrumb enhances findability on store pages.

## What you need to do

To guarantee that the component is available on mobile mode as well, ensure that your store runs [**Breadcrumb**](https://github.com/vtex-apps/breadcrumb) version __1.6.0__ or higher.
