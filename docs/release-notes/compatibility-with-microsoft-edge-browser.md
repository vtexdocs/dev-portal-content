The Store Framework v2 is now compatible with the Microsoft Edge Browser from Windows.

## What has changed

Previously, a store built on Store Framework v2 wouldn't run properly on the Microsoft Edge browser.

## Key Advantage

According to Wikipedia, almost 4% of desktop users depend on the Microsoft Edge browser to navigate in websites. This means that this feature could increase the access to the framework's hosted stores up to 4%.
