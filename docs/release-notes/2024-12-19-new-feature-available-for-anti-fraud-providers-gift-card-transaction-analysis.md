Anti-fraud providers integrated with VTEX can now analyze payment transactions made with [gift cards](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gift-card--tutorials_995).

## What has changed?

The `allowAntifraudOnGiftCard` field was created within the [Anti-fraud Provider Protocol](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/how-the-integration-protocol-between-vtex-and-antifraud-companies-works), allowing anti-fraud providers to indicate whether they provide the service for processing gift card transaction data in a VTEX store.

Gift card transaction information is sent to providers through the [Send anti-fraud pre-analysis data (optional)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/antifraud-provider-protocol#post-/pre-analysis) or [Send anti-fraud data](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/antifraud-provider-protocol#post-/transactions) endpoints, as in payment operations made by credit or debit card.

See an example of a payload sent on the [Send anti-fraud data](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/antifraud-provider-protocol#post-/transactions) endpoint, showing the gift card information in the payments object.
