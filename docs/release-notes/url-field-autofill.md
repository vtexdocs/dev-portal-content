The admin's Pages section now allows the `URL` field to autofill when creating a new page for your store.

## What has changed

Previously, the system could not allow the text written in the `Title` field to be autofilled in the `URL` field, so the user had to manually type the desired path when creating a new page. 

## Main advantages 

With the autofill feature, the `URL` field becomes more practical and useful for non-technical users mainly because **it applies best SEO practices** to the path's structure, such as eliminating capital letters from titles and the use of hyphens instead of spaces to separate words. 

## What you need to do 

Make sure you store has the [<code>admin-pages</code>](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.admin-pages) app [installed](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app) on version **4.12.6** or higher.
