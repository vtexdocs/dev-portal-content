A language selector has been added to the admin’s Storefront. The selector takes a user’s location into account.

## What has changed

Previously, to edit content in different languages in Storefront, the user had to change the admin’s language selector which only supported English, Portuguese, and Spanish.

With this change, a new language selector has been added to Storefront’s top bar interface, allowing users to select the language in which they want to add or edit store content.

## Key advantage

Storefront is now able to support languages having different locales, e.g: `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`, `en-US`, `en-GB`.

## What you need to do

1. Make sure your [**VTEX Admin Pages**](https://github.com/vtex-apps/admin-pages) app runs version **4.6.0** or newer.
2. Make sure the [**VTEX Messages**](https://github.com/vtex-apps/admin-messages) app is installed.
3. Configure the languages that the store can support by accessing **Apps** from your admin’s **Account Settings** and selecting the **VTEX Messages** box.

4. In CMS, go to the **Storefront** section and select the language previously configured.
