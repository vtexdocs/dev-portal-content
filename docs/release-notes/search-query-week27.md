Due to an adaption of our Search component to use more performant APIs, our searches now take __50% less time__ to display results to the user.

## What has changed

Previously, our search engine used a slower API to retrieve data, having a direct impact on the search component’s time performance.

## Main advantage

With the search becoming a lot faster, this improvement is providing a greater user experience, decreasing friction that was a result of prolonged interactions between the search term and the results page.

## What you need to do

In order to improve your store’s search performance, ensure that at least version __2.88.2__ of the [Store Graphql](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-graphql) app is installed.
