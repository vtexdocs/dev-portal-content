In order to enhance system security, new Checkout configuration options have been made available, expanding protective measures against potential bot attacks.

## What has changed?

The following fields have been added to your store's orderForm configuration and can be modified via the endpoint [Update an account's orderForm configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/update-an-account-orderform-configuration).

- `requiresLoginToPlaceOrder`: indicates whether purchases can only be completed by customers already [authenticated in the store](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/authentication-page--21CkKHLKP1o41lUpGhuRUs#login-methods).
- `minimumPurchaseDowntimeSeconds`: defines a minimum amount of time (in seconds) for a buyer to wait before making another purchase.

>⚠️ This setting is most efficient when combined with mandatory login during the checkout process (previous configuration).

- `cartAgeToUseNewCardSeconds`: defines the minimum amount of time (in seconds) in which the cart must have been created to allow a new credit card to be applied to it.

## What needs to be done?

If you wish to enable these settings on your store's checkout, see the [Update an account's orderForm configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/update-an-account-orderform-configuration) endpoint documentation. Otherwise, there is no action needed.
