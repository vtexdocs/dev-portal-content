Another CSS Handles release is in the house. Important components of a store have had their elements befitted with their own Handles:

- **Telemarketing**
- **Search Result**
- **Menu**

## What has changed

Previously, all telemarketing layout blocks didn't have Handles. Therefore, retailers and users of the telemarketing functionality could not independently customize that section of their store:

In addition, several search result blocks and menu elements lacked customizations, not having their own CSS Handles.

## Main advantages 

Without CSS Handles, the store depended on CSS Selectors, which looked at a page's HTML structure, when selecting an element for customization. 

This store customization practice, in addition to being vulnerable, was mostly [deprecated](https://vtex.io/docs/releases/2019-week-43-44/css-selectors-deprecation). Therefore, launching these Handles for several store components is of **strategic importance**.

## What you need to do

To get your hands on the new Handles, you need to update three different apps. 

Below, you can check each app's name and their respective **minimum required version** that should run in your store to be able to freely start customizing your store:

- [Search Result](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.search-result/) : **3.39.8**
- [Telemarketing](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.telemarketing/): **2.9.8**
- [Menu](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.menu/): **2.20.2**
