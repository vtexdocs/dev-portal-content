![Store Framework](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/styles-builder-1-x-technical-support-ends-on-february-02-2022-0.png)

We **strongly recommend** that accounts using the deprecated Styles Builder 1. x **migrate to the major 2. x.** before February 02, 2022. After this date, **we will no longer offer support for Styles Builder 1. x.**

## What has changed?

[Styles Builder 1.x has been deprecated since December of 2019](https://vtex.io/docs/releases/2019-week-43-44/css-selectors-deprecation/) and now VTEX is ceasing its support in favor of its most recent version.

The Styles Builderâ€™s major 2. x is already available, and It offers better store stability when working with [CSS handles for store customization](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-css-handles-for-store-customization), avoiding potential breakdowns on store layouts.

## What needs to be done?

To successfully migrate from Styles Builder 1.x to Styles Builder 2.x, you must update the version of the `styles` builder in the `manifest.json` file of your Store Theme app, as the example below:

```
builders{
...
"styles": "2.x"
}
```

In the following, check the [best practices of CSS handles](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-css-handles-for-store-customization#best-practices) to review and update every CSS customization for your store elements.
