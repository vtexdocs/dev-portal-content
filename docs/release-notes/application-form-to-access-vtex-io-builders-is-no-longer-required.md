Until recently, we restricted access to some of our VTEX IO builders in a closed beta. Any app developer that wanted access to a specific builder on IO needed to fill out a form requesting access.

## What has changed?

We no longer require app developers to fill out the application form to use VTEX IO builders previously tagged as closed beta. Starting today, all of our builders are publicly available to use until further notice.

## What needs to be done?

To use a specific builder, you need to add it to the [manifest](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-manifest) of your app. You also need `vtex.builder-hub@0.293.4` or a more recent version [installed](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-usage#installing-an-app) in your account. 

For more information, check our [builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders) documentation.
