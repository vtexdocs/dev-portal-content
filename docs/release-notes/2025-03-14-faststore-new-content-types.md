FastStore projects now include two new Content Types available in the Headless CMS: **Global Header Sections** and **Global Footer Sections**. These Content Types provide a more organized way to manage global headers and footers across the store.

Now headers and footers can be customized independently, improving performance by reducing the data load associated with Global Sections.

## What has changed?

The existing Global Sections still remain in place and these new Content Types can be applied to all store pages:

- **Global Header Sections:** Defines the content for the global header, which appears in the header area of every page (before the [Children section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview#sections)).
- **Global Footer Sections:** Defines the content for the global footer, which appears at in the footer area of every page (after the [Children section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview#sections)).

## Why did we make this change?

As stores grow, managing global content becomes more complex. The introduction of Global Header Sections and Footer Sections simplifies the process by making content management more organized and scalable.

## What needs to be done?

To start using the new Content Types, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to your FastStore project folder.
2. In the terminal, log in to your account by running `vtex login {accountName}`.

    > âš  Change `{accountName}` for your account name, for example, `vtex login mystore`.

3. Updating the `@fastore/cli` package version by running `yarn add @faststore/cli@latest`.
4. Run `yarn cms-sync` to update your project with the new Content Types.
5. Go to your store VTEX Admin, and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
6. Click `Create document` and select either Content Types, **Global Header Sections** or **Global Footer Sections**.
