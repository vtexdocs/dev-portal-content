---

After March 18, 2024, all FastStore content currently available on the [FastStore Portal](htttps://faststore.dev) will be relocated and redirected to the [Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com).

## What has changed?

Currently, all FastStore content is in the [FastStore Portal](htttps://faststore.dev).
To keep VTEX documentation centralized in one place and maintain a single source of truth, we are migrating the FastStore documentation to the Developer Portal.

## Why did we make this change?

- **Unified Experience:** Access VTEX documentation from a unified platform for seamless navigation and resource availability.
- **Centralized Information:** Find all VTEX Storefront solutions documentation in one place.

## What needs to be done?

After March 18, 2024, access the FastStore content in the Developer Portal section for [FastStore](/). Do not worry about updating bookmarks or links, your access will automatically redirect to the new section in the Developer Portal.
