The Product Specification Badges component aims to show badges in the Product page based on the product's [specifications](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/what-are-fields-or-specifications--2lB4AgibEseceMggKE2k2m).

_In this example, the productâ€™s specification was <code>on sale</code>_.

## Main advantages

The specifications allow more of store's SKU details to be displayed. Therefore, the new component enriches user navigation, giving users **more visibility and knowledge about SKUs** on sale.  

## What you need to do 

Make sure you already have the `product-specification-badge` [installed](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app) in your store.

:eyes: For more details regarding its implementation, do not forget to have a look at its [documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.product-specification-badges). Also, have a look at the [Stack Layout documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.stack-layout) which this feature uses to function.
