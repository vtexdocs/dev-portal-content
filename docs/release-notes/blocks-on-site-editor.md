The admin's Site Editor now allows you to edit three more Store Framework elements:

- **Search Bar placeholder**

- **Product Description Title**

## What has changed

These elements could only be edited directly through the theme's source code. You can now edit them directly using the account's admin. 

## Key advantages

The advantages of an expanding Site Editor are well known: a **better UX** and **independence** for retailers, allowing for more **freedom** and **less dependency** on the code and related technical knowledge.

## What you need to do

The Site Editor is so incredible that **no installation is needed**. Just access the admin of the account in which you are working and use and abuse the new feature!
