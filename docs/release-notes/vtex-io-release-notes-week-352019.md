Welcome to the VTEX IO weekly release notes!

We're extremely happy to have achieved 10 straight weeks of VTEX IO Release Notes 🎉 We hope that you're excited as well!

Unfortunately, this week's Release Notes size does not do justice to our impish glee with this achievement. This one comes in a mini format since our team is laser focused on improving the platform's performance.

Check out what were the key changes for the last week:

### New features 🚀

- [Google Search Box script](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-35/google-search-box-script.md) - Effortlessly display a store's internal search box during Google searches and watch how page access soars.

### Improvements ➕

- [Platform performance](https://github.com/vtex-apps/release-notes/blob/master/docs/2019-week-35/platform-performance.md) - Understand last week's VTEX IO key performance improvement points.

### Notable bug fixes 🐛

- [Shelf `itemsPerPage` limit](https://github.com/vtex-apps/shelf/pull/176) - The Shelf component had a bug that limited the number of items it displayed to 5. Now, whatever number of items the `itemsPerPage` decides is duly displayed.
- [RelatedShelf component](https://github.com/vtex-apps/shelf/pull/179) - The RelatedShelf no longer displays a maximum quantity of products due to not being able to properly identify if it's rendering for mobile or not.
