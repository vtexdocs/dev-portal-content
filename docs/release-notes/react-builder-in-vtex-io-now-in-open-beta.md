![Store Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/images/react-builder-in-vtex-io-now-in-open-beta-0.png)

Before, developers interested in creating custom components in [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/what-is-vtex-io) using the [VTEX Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/what-is-store-framework) had to request VTEX authorization. They had to fill in an application form sharing their project's details and wait for our approval to use the React [builder](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-builders).

This is no longer required, as **we officially move our React builder to open beta status**. You can take advantage of this autonomy to further customize and improve your storefront experience using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) technology.

> ⚠️ **This change applies only to the React builder**. We continue to require that you fill in the [Application form for development](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-filling-the-application-form-for-development) and wait for our approval if your project depends on builders that are still in closed beta. This includes, for example, back-end integrations using Node.js and GraphQL.
