---

On March 1st, 2026, the [Register modifications on order](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api#post-/api/oms/pvt/orders/-orderId-/changes) endpoint will be deprecated. We have stopped providing support for this API in December 31st, 2025.

## What has changed?

The [Create order modifications](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api#patch-/api/order-system/orders/-changeOrderId-/changes) offers an improved order modification experience, with the possibility of previewing, retrying, and cancelling the changes. You can also get the changes details, summary, full history, and settings.

As a result, the Register modifications on order endpoint will be deactivated on March 1st, 2026.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required.
