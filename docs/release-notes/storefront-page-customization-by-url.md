> ℹ️ This feature became available on June 18th, 2019.

## What has changed

Previously, it was not possible to directly navigate to the desired page using just your URL in Storefront. You had to navigate through the store site until coming across the page you wish to edit.

## Main advantage

This new feature improves the user’s browsing experience, allowing users to access and customize their store in a simpler and faster way.

## What you need to do

To have access to this feature, make sure your store’s admin has Pages app version __3.15.0__ is installed.
