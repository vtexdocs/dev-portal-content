The generation of routes within the [Sitemap](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-sitemap) will be temporarily deactivated to ensure the reliability and stability of our services during the high-demand period of the shopping season 2024.

>ℹ️ Only stores developed with Store Framework will be impacted.

## When will we deactivate it?

- **Start date:** Tuesday, November 26
- **End date:** Tuesday, December 3

## Why did we make this change?

As generating routes is resource-intensive, it may overload catalog-related services during high-demand periods like the shopping season. This process increases the demand for additional rewriter replicas to handle Sitemap requests, resulting in higher CPU usage in databases.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required.
