> ⚠️ This feature is only available for FastStore stores that use the [VTEX Ad Network](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-ad-network-beta--2cgqXcBuJmXN2livQvClur) solution. To enable it, contact [Commercial Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/3KQWGgkPOwbFTPfBxL7YwZ) and request the app to be installed on your VTEX account.

FastStore now supports displaying sponsored products when using [Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb), helping merchants interested in the [VTEX Ad Network](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-ad-network-beta--2cgqXcBuJmXN2livQvClur) solution.
