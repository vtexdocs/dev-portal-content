Some customers may experience content loss in Site Editor when promoting a production workspace to master due to workspace conflicts.

To prevent this issue, the VTEX IO CLI workspace plugin has been updated to `v1.2.0`.

## What has changed?

In `v1.2.0` of the VTEX IO CLI workspace plugin, rebase conflicts are identified and solved before the production workspace is promoted to the target workspace.

## What needs to be done?

To update the VTEX IO CLI workspace plugin to `v1.2.0`, follow the steps below:

1. With VTEX IO CLI, log in to your VTEX account by running the `vtex login {accountName}` command.

   >âš  Replace `{accountName}` based on your scenario.

2. Update the `@vtex/cli-plugin-workspace` to `v1.2.0` by running the `vtex plugins update` command. Another option is to directly install the new version by running the `vtex plugins install @vtex/cli-plugin-workspace@1.2.0` command.
