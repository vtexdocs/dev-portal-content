Stores can now **verify user access conditions** to a given trade policy thanks to the new Challenge Trade Policy Condition app.

## What has changed 

Previously, stores could specify business rules for a given sales channel through a trade policy, but not for users. This meant that it was not possible to directly control which users could access a particular trade policy and its content.

Now, trade policies can establish **condition rules**, meaning validation rules to check whether or not a user could in fact view their content. All made possible by the new Challenge Trade Policy Condition app.

_In the image above, only users whose profiles were tagged as approved will be able to access the EUA trade policy_.

## Main advantages 

The Challenge Trade Policy Condition ensures stores and their restricted **content more privacy**, better **serving B2B stores' business policies**.

## What you need to do 

You can find details related to the implementation and use of the **Challenge Trade Policy Condition** accessing the app's [**documentation**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.challenge-tp-condition/).
