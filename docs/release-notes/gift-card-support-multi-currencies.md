As of July 30, 2023, you will be able to create gift cards in currencies other than those added to your store. This new feature allows you to indicate in which currency the gift card should be created when adding a new gift card in the VTEX Admin.
 
Also, a new optional field (`currencyCode`) has been added to the endpoints below, enabling you to identify the currency applicable to each gift card.

>⚠️ Setting a specific currency for each gift card is optional. If you do not want to indicate in which currency it should be created, the behavior will remain the same as in a store using only one currency type, where discounts on the amount are applied without currency conversion.
