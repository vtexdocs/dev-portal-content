We have launched the [Affiliates Program app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/affiliates-program-app), unlocking a new partnership model between VTEX stores and associates who promote sales in exchange for commission. Anyone registered and approved by your store can become an affiliate.

> ℹ️ For the **Affiliates Program app**, an affiliate is different from the standard definition of [affiliate in VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-afiliado--4bN3e1YarSEammk2yOeMc0). In the app’s context, an affiliate is anyone who associates with a VTEX store to promote sales while receiving a commission.

> The **Affiliates Program app** is compatible only with stores using [VTEX IO](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/4yB9wSl79cArd68aRBnBZ2), and it is not available for stores using [Legacy CMS](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj) or [Headless CMS](https://faststore.dev/tutorials/cms/0#vtex-headless-cms).

The **Affiliates Program app** creates a specific URL of your VTEX store for each of your affiliates, and every URL is targeted with a parameter that identifies the affiliate. When an affiliate shares their URL with clients, and they buy something through that link, the affiliate earns a commission over sales.

The app also provides a profile page and dashboard for the affiliates to keep track of orders and commissions associated with them, as can be seen in the image below:

After [installing the app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/affiliates-program-app#installation) in your VTEX store, three new pages will be available in VTEX Admin, under *Other > Affiliates*:

- Affiliate Management
- Orders Management
- Commissions Management

> If using the [New VTEX Admin](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/), the pages will be under *Apps > Affiliates*.

On these pages, you can manage everything related to your affiliates, making use of multiple filters and exporting data via email. They look like the example below:

The app is available on [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-affiliates/p) and you can find more information in the [Affiliates Program app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/affiliates-program-app) guide.
