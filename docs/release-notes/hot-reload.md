The Hot Reload enables all the changes you've performed in your code editor to be automatically reflected in your browser, without the need to refresh the workspace page in which you're working.

:eyes: Hot Reload only works when existing content is changed and saved, and not when it's created from scratch. 

## Main advantages

The Hot Reload brings developers the benefit of making the coding process more spontaneous and simpler.

## What you need to do

You don't need to do anything (YAY :tada:). This new feature is already available for you to use and abuse during your development process.
