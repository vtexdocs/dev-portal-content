The Search Results Page now accepts the `flex-layout` block as child. 

## Main advantages

By declaring rows e columns, `flex-layout` allows the **construction of complex and custom layouts** for your store page. Hence, it's very advantageous to accept such a block as child, which is what the Search Results Page has now gained, giving it more flexibility and the power of having a layout. 

## What you need to do 

Simply ensure that your store is running [`search-result`](https://vtex.io/docs/components/search/vtex.search-result) app version **3.32.0** or higher.  

Also, do not forget to access our documentation to learn more about [using `flex-layout`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-flex-layout).
