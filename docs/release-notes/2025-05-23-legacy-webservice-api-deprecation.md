excerpt: "The Webservice API will be discontinued on VTEX as of September 1st, 2025."
---

As of **September 1, 2025**, the Webservice API will be permanently discontinued on the VTEX platform. This means that clients using this legacy service must migrate their operations to VTEX's current [REST APIs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference). Additionally, starting now, accounts that don’t use Webservice can no longer contract it.

## What has changed?

The Webservice API is a technology that uses an outdated protocol, which limits the performance of our merchants' operations.

The VTEX platform has evolved and developed REST APIs, which use updated protocols and offer better and more secure conditions for store operations. Our current [API reference](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference) covers the Webservice use cases and provides more capabilities.

## What needs to be done?

Stores using the Webservice API must migrate to [REST APIs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference) by **September 1, 2025**, when the legacy service will be permanently deprecated. Your operation must address any changes required by this migration.

The deprecation will have no impact if you don’t use the Webservice API. However, this legacy service can no longer be requested.
