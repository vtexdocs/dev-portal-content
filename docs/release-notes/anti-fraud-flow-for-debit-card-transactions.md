Starting on July 1st, 2023, debit card transactions at VTEX stores can be processed with an extra layer of protection (pre-analysis anti-fraud). Through this new flow, you can offer greater security to your customers in transactions made by debit cards.

To learn how to apply this new layer of security, read [Implementing a pre-analysis antifraud flow for debit card transactions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/implementing-a-pre-analysis-antifraud-flow-for-debit-card-transactions).
