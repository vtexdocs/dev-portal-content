Easily **integrate your store with the** [**Hotjar**](https://www.hotjar.com/tour) **solution** by simply using the VTEX IO Hotjar first party integration app.

The Hotjar is a solution aimed at giving the retailer visibility over the customer's store browsing, using heat maps, visitor recordings and conversion funnels.

## What has changed

Previously, **a native integration with the Hotjar solution did not exist**. To use it with a store in IO, Hotjar had to be installed through Google Tag Manager as a Custom HTML tag.

The problem with this type of Hotjar integration using GTM is that it's limited, since it doesn't allow retailers to properly use JavaScript features in their store.

That being said, the native integration was developed so that **retailers can use Hotjar while simultaneously using Javascript features such as recording tags and triggers**.

## Main advantages

Our native app ensures VTEX IO stores to integrate with the Hotjar solution in a **better**, **faster** and **easier way**.

**Installing the Hotjar app does not automatically contract Hotjar services**, but merely provides a native integration together with a solution. It is therefore only available to those that already use this solution in their store.

## What you need to do

In order to natively integrate your store with the Bazaarvoice solution, you can access the [**Hotjar app documentation**](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.hotjar) and follow the guidelines provided therein.
