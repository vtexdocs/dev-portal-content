Sandbox blocks can now be declared in your store's Minicart and be rendered in the component's lower side.

> ℹ️ To understand more about what Sandbox blocks are and how to use them, access our [documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-sandbox-blocks).

## What has changed

Previously, the Minicart didn't allow Sandbox blocks to be declared. As a result, the component could only be customized with its own props and styles. 

Now, Minicart allows Sandbox blocks to be declared in it. 

> ⚠️ **Notice** that Sandbox blocks rendering will take place in the Minicart component's lower edge, meaning after the product list but before the total price.

## Main advantages

Minicart component now became much more **flexible**, heeding your store's style needs, since Sandbox blocks allow HTML, CSS and JavaScript customizations.

## What you need to do

Make sure you've installed [**Minicart**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/product/vtex.minicart) component version **2.26.0** or higher.
