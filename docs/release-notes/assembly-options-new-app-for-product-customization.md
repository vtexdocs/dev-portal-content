We have launched a new app to make product customization easier. It uses [Assembly Options](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/assembly-options--5x5FhNr4f5RUGDEGWzV1nH) and [attachments](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-an-attachment--aGICk0RVbqKg6GYmQcWUm) for complex scenarios where it is necessary to manage different product combinations, quantities, additional items, and costs.

The app is only available for stores developed using Store Framework. Before using it, you need to [install and configure Product Customizer](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-product-customizer) in your store.

The **Assembly Options** app enables an interface to set up and manage customization options, illustrated below. This experience aims to offer an alternative to the manual configuration available through **Catalog > Attachments** using a specific syntax.

You can install it for free from the VTEX App Store or using the [VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference), following the steps in the [Assembly Options app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/assembly-options-app) guide. After the installation, the **Products > Assembly options** page becomes available on VTEX Admin.

For more details about how to use the new page, read the [Assembly Options](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/assembly-options--5x5FhNr4f5RUGDEGWzV1nH) user guide.
