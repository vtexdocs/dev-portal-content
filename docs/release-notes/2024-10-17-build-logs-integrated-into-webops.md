The FastStore WebOps app now provides direct access to build logs for each store deployment in the VTEX Admin. This improvement helps you monitor deployment status and quickly understand the success or failure of each build.

## What has changed?

Previously, build logs were only accessible through GitHub.

Now, build logs are also available directly on the WebOps page of the VTEX Admin. With build logs integrated alongside other store information, you gain a better understanding of the deployment context, making it easier to share build logs with team members for faster troubleshooting and problem-solving.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. The build logs feature is already available on the WebOps page of the Admin. For more information, see the [WebOps Dashboard documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#build-logs).
