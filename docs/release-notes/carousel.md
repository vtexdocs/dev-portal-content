Build a Carousel component in your store using **Slider Layout** and a **list block**.

_When inspecting the page, notice that the `carousel` block was not used to build the component._ 

## What has changed

Prior to this release, there was only one way to configure the Carousel component in your store: through the `carousel` block itself. 

## Key advantages 

The new component blocks configuration grants the component **more flexibility** and thus provides retailers with **more layout possibilities**.

For example: the former Carousel only accepted one image per slide. Given its new configuration, you can now add as many images as you want.

## What you need to do 

We recommend the use of Slider Layout and lists for new stores as well as for those already live, since bug support for the `carousel` block is winding down as more stores adopt the component's new configuration.

For more on how to adapt your store to this release, access our documentation on [**how to build a carousel component using list blocks and the Slider Layout**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-building-a-carousel-using-slider-layout).
