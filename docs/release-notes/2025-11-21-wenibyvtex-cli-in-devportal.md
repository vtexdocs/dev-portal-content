To provide a unified and accessible documentation experience, we integrated the CLI documentation for Weni by VTEX into the VTEX Developers Portal.

Weni by VTEX offers post-sales support solutions powered by data, artificial intelligence, and agents, with a platform to enhance customer experience (CX). The Weni by VTEX CLI allows you to create customized AI multi-agents, enabling developers to build, deploy, and manage AI agents with tailored tools and functionalities across various communication channels.

### What has changed

Previously, this documentation was available through the Weni portal. However, this portal is being deprecated, and the CLI documentation is only available in the VTEX Developers Portal.

Now, there is a Weni by VTEX category in the Guides, including the following articles for the CLI:

- [Using the Weni by VTEX CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/wenibyvtex-guide)
- [Weni by VTEX CLI Command Reference](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/wenicli-command-reference)
- [Authenticating with your Weni by VTEX account](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/authentication)
- [Managing your Weni by VTEX projects](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/project-management)
- [Understanding the core concepts](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/core-concepts)
- [Working with agents](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/working-with-agents)
- [Fetching and filtering logs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/logs)
- [Testing the Tool Run feature](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/tool-run)

### What needs to be done

To access the CLI documentation, go to [Weni by VTEX CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/weni-by-vtex-cli) in the VTEX Developers Portal instead of the legacy Weni documentation portal.
