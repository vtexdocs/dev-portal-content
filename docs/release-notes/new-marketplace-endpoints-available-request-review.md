We have just launched new endpoints in our Marketplace API, that allow marketplace operators to ask sellers to review their SKUs, before approving them to their catalog and also retrieve inventory levels and price values of the already matched suggestions in their catalog.

Check out the API Reference for the new endpoints:

- [Get SKU’s review information](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/review-received-skus#get-sku-review-information)
- [Request Review of Received SKUs](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/review-received-skus#request-sku-review)
- [Get Matched Offer's Data by Product ID](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/marketplace-apis#get-/offer-manager/pvt/product/-productId-)
- [Get Matched Offer's Data by SKU ID](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/marketplace-apis#get-/offer-manager/pvt/product/-productId-/sku/-skuId-)
