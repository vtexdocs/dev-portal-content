The Menu component’s expanding behavior was improved for mobile.

## What has changed

Previously, when a submenu was triggered, the Menu component did not exhibit a user-friendly behavior. Its frame size would not expand, displaying a scroll-bar anytime a user needed to click on something in a submenu.

At present, the frame is expanded regardless of the size hierarchical level of the sub-menu being clicked on.

## Key advantage

With this release, the menu usability is improved, providing users with a better browsing experience.

## What you need to do

Make sure you have at least version __2.17.1__ of the [Menu component](https://github.com/vtex-apps/menu) installed in your store.
