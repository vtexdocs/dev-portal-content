FastStore storefronts now support the [refresh token flow](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/security-enabling-refresh-token), ensuring users stay logged in longer without reauthenticating.

## What has changed?

Previously, user sessions in stores were managed by a cookie that expired after 24 hours, requiring users to log in again if they returned after a day.

With the refresh token, users remain logged in for longer without manually reauthenticating. As long as the user accesses the store within the refresh tokenâ€™s configured timeframe (1, 7, or 30 days), their session is automatically renewed, keeping them logged in.

## Why did we make this change?

By extending session duration, shoppers can remain logged in longer, resulting in a more seamless shopping experience and fewer login prompts.

## What needs to be done?

To enable the refresh token flow in your account, see the instructions in the [Enabling refresh token on FastStore](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/security-enabling-refresh-token) guide.
