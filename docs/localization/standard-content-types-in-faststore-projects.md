Headless CMS [Content Types](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-3-adding-content-types-and-sections#step-2-adding-content-types-to-the-headless-cms) are the building blocks for creating a scalable and maintainable storefront in FastStore. After onboarding via the [FastStore WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview) app, these Content Types are pre-implemented in your starter store, enabling you to quickly build pages like the Home, Product Listing, and Custom Landing.

Content Types are organized by [Scopes](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-managing-content-with-scopes-and-requiredscopes#scopes), which define the context in which each Content Type can be used. They categorize Content Types based on their functionality. For example, a Content Type with a `pdp` scope can only be used on PDPs.

The following table provides an overview of the standard Content Types, their IDs, scopes, and their respective purposes.

> â„¹ These standard Content Types are natively implemented. You can view their structure in the [content-types.json](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/blob/main/packages/core/cms/faststore/content-types.json) file.
