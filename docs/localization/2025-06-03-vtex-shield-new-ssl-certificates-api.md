The new **SSL Certificates API** allows merchants using [VTEX Shield](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-shield--2CVk6H9eY2CBtHjtDI7BFh) to manage [custom SSL certificates](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/custom-ssl-certificates--1hoaDEbU50PDZSe6AYep9q) directly on VTEX infrastructure. This feature is designed for businesses with specific compliance or security requirements.

The SSL Certificates API includes the following endpoints:

* GET [List SSL certificates](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/ssl-certificates-api#get-/api/edge/certificates): Lists all custom SSL certificates installed in the store.
* GET [Get SSL certificate by ID](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/ssl-certificates-api#get-/api/edge/certificates/-certificateId-): Retrieves details of a specific certificate by its ID.
* PUT [Install or renew SSL certificate](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/ssl-certificates-api#put-/api/edge/certificates): Installs or renews certificates by uploading their contents using either JSON or multipart/form-data formats.
