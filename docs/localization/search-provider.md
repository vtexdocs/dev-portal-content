`SearchProvider` is a React component that wraps an entire page, such as a Product Listing Page, to provide the necessary context for the faceted search. Faceted search allows users to filter and refine search results based on specific attributes (e.g., price, category, brand, etc.).

## Import

```tsx
import { SearchProvider } from '@faststore/sdk'
```

## Usage

The following example demonstrates how to implement faceted search using `SearchProvider`:

```tsx
import { SearchProvider, parseSearchState } from '@faststore/sdk'

function Page () {
  const params = useMemo(() => parseSearchState(new URL(window.href)), [])

  return (
    <SearchProvider
      onChange={(url: URL) => window.location.href = url.href}
      itemsPerPage={12}
      {...params}
    >
      {children}
    </SearchProvider>
  )
}
```

- `SearchProvider`: The React component that provides search context.
- `parseSearchState`: Parses the current URL and extracts the search state (e.g., `sort`, `term`, `page`, etc.).
- `children`: The components wrapped by `SearchProvider`, which will have access to the search context.

## Props

The `SearchProvider` component accepts the following props:

| Prop | Type | Description |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| `onChange` | `(url: URL) => void` | Callback function responsible for handling changes in the facet state. It updates the page URL when search parameters change. |
| `itemsPerPage` | `number` | Number of product items displayed on a given page. |
| `sort` | `SearchSort` | Sorting criteria of the search result (e.g., `price_asc`, `orders_desc`, `discount_desc`, etc.). |
| `term` | `string / null` | Full-text term used on the search. |
| `page` | `number` | Current page index of search pagination. |
| `base` | `string` | Base URL path of the search page. Useful when dealing with localization and prefixing paths by locale (e.g., /pt-br/). |
| `selectedFacets` | `Array<{ key: string, value: string }>` | Array of selected facets on the search. |
| `passThrough` | `URLSearchParams` | Additional URL parameters to preserve when building URLs. |

> âš  Don't include personalization facets, such as sales channel and price tables, on the `selectedFacets` property. If you do so, users may end up having two channels: one from the Session context and another from the URL, which may cause unexpected behaviors.
