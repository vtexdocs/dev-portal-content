The [Product Specification](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-components/productspecifications) `visibleSpecifications` and `hiddenSpecifications` props can now be edited through the admin's Site Editor.

## Main advantages

Whenever a component, such as Product Specification, gains the flexibility to be editable (whether in part or in full) using Site Editor, retailers become independent from the source code and are able to configure their stores as desired.

## What you need to do

Make sure your store is already running [**Store Components**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-components) version **3.85.0** or higher.
