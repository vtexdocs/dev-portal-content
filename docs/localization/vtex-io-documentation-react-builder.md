The `react` builder is used to develop apps with [React](https://react.dev/) when your project requires customized frontend solutions beyond our native components.

This builder interprets the `/react` directory, where you must place the app’s React code using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). When you run your app, this code is transformed into compiled bundles, ready for use in frontend apps.

To learn how to implement apps using this builder, check our [Storefront apps guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-1-developing-storefront-apps-using-react-and-vtex-io).

> ℹ️ The `react` builder runs on `React v16` by default. This means that any custom components, design systems, or third‑party libraries you use in your VTEX IO apps must be compatible with `React v16`. Learn more about this version in the [React documentation](https://16.reactjs.org/).

## Folder structure

An app that uses the `react` builder has a folder named `/react` in its root directory. The directory structure may vary depending on the development preferences or specific project settings.

The basic structure of a React folder is composed of the following files, as you can see in the [React boilerplate app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/react-app-template/tree/master/react):

```txt
react
 ┣ 📂 typings
 ┣ 📄 {ReactCodeFileName}.tsx
 ┣ 📄 package.json
 ┣ 📄 tsconfig.json
 ┗ 📄 yarn.lock
```

- `typings`: Folder holding TypeScript type definitions.
- `.tsx` files: Contain the source code of React components. Replace `{ReactCodeFileName}` according to your scenario.
- `tsconfig.json`: Specifies how the TypeScript compiler should behave, indicating the root directory and the output directory for the compiled code, among other project settings for TypeScript. Check the [`tsconfig.json` documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) to learn more about this file.
- `package.json`: Defines the project’s metadata, dependencies, and custom scripts using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/migration/overview), and other configuration settings.
- `yarn.lock`: Locks down the exact versions of your project’s dependencies, including transitive dependencies, to ensure consistent builds across different machines and environments. This file is automatically generated based on the dependencies in your `package.json` file.

## Usage

To use the `react` builder, follow these steps:

1. Clone the React [boilerplate app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/react-app-template/tree/master/react) to your local files.
2. Modify the `manifest.json` file in the React example app to include your app’s metadata, such as its name, version, vendor, and dependencies. The `react` builder must also be declared in the app’s `manifest.json` file as follows:
    
    ```json
    "builders": {
        "react": "3.x"
    }
    ```

3. [Link your app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-linking-an-app) to a development workspace.

## Use case examples

The `react` builder is versatile and enables the development of frontend apps with different characteristics and objectives. The [default template](#understanding-the-apps-file-structure) provides only the essential files, but the possibilities are countless.

Below is an example of a React component and its folders and files within the `react` directory.

The [VTEX Store Components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-components) is a collection of components that can be used to create or extend other VTEX apps.

>ℹ️ An app using the `react` builder can export a single or multiple components.

This collection is composed of some components, such as [Availability Subscriber](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-components/availabilitysubscriber), [Back To Top Button](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-components/backtotopbutton), [SKU Selector](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-components/skuselector), [Search Bar](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-components/searchbar), among others.

The app's file structure includes folders and files that enable the use of the collection’s React components. You can check some of them below:

```txt
react
 ┣ 📂 components
 ┣ 📂 graphql
 ┣ 📂 typings
 ┣ 📂 utils
 ┣ 📄 {FileName}.tsx
 ┣ 📄 {FileName}.tsx
 ┣ 📄 {FileName}.js
 ┣ 📄 {FileName}.js
 ┣ 📄 …
 ┣ 📄 package.json
 ┣ 📄 tsconfig.json
 ┗ 📄 yarn.lock
```

- The `components` folder contains the folders of each React component.
- The `graphql` folder contains GraphQL queries and mutations, which some components use to communicate with the backend. Keeping GraphQL code separate from other parts of the React component promotes modularity and facilitates the management of queries, mutations, or subscriptions specific to the React component.
- The `utils` folder contains utility functions or helper modules used by some components.
