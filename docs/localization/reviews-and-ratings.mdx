title: Reviews and Ratings
--- 

The Reviews and Ratings feature allows shoppers to view, rate, and provide feedback on products purchased in your store, enriching product detail pages (PDPs) with user-generated content.

This solution supports star ratings, review listing, filtering, and sorting options. Authenticated users can leave feedback directly on the product page.

## App behavior

* **Authentication required:** Only logged-in customers can submit reviews. Anonymous reviews aren’t supported.
* **Reviews management:** Customers cannot view or manage a list of their submitted reviews. 
* **Automatic approval:** All reviews are automatically approved and published upon submission without prior moderation. Still, store administrators can remove individual reviews anytime using the Reviews and Ratings app through VTEX Admin.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Install the Reviews and Ratings app

1. Open your terminal and log in to your account by running the command `vtex login {accountName}`. Replace the values between the curly brackets according to your scenario.
2. Run the `vtex list` command to list all VTEX apps installed in the active account and workspace.
3. Check if you have the `Reviews and Ratings` app. If you have, go to the following (#updating-the-faststore-cli-package-version) step.
4. If you don’t have the app, run the `vtex install vtex.reviews-and-ratings@3.x` command to install the Reviews and Ratings app in your account. It’s expected that you receive the message: `info: Installed app vtex.reviews-and-ratings@3.x successfully`.

### Update the `@faststore/cli` package version

Make sure your store uses the latest version of the [`faststore/cli`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-cli) package:

1. Open your FastStore codebase in the code editor of your choice.
2. Open the terminal and run the `yarn add @faststore/cli@latest` command.
3. Run `yarn dev` to sync the changes to your project

</Steps>

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Enabling `reviewsAndRatings`

1. Open the `discovery.config.js` file in your project.
2. Set the `reviewsAndRatings` field to **true**.

 ```javascript discovery.config.js
 module.exports = {
   ...
   reviewsAndRatings: true,
 }
 ```

>ℹ️ This feature is enabled by default. To disable, go to the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file and set the `reviewsAndRatings` field to **false**.

### Step 2 - Syncing FastStore project with Headless CMS

Run the `faststore cms-sync` command to sync the `cms` folder of your FastStore project with the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview).

The expected response is that you receive the message `CMS synced successfully...`. The native components of the Reviews and Ratings feature will be automatically updated.

### Step 3 - Adding `ReviewsAndRatings` section

The `ReviewsAndRatings` section displays customer feedback and product ratings.

1. Access your VTEX Admin and go to **Storefront > Headless CMS > Product Details Page**.
2. In the Sections tab, click `+` to open a modal with a list of section options.
3. Search for the **ReviewsAndRatings** section and click on it to add.
4. Click `Save` to save your changes.
5. Click `Publish` to open a dropdown list with the options `Add to Release`, to schedule the update, and `Publish now`, to publish immediately. Choose the most suitable option for your scenario.

### Step 4 - [Optional] Customizing Reviews and Ratings

To customize your component, see the [List of Native Sections and Overridable Components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections#reviews-and-ratings) to check the components that can be overridden.
