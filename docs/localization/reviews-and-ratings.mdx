title: Reviews and Ratings
--- 

The Reviews and Ratings feature allows shoppers to view, submit feedback, and rate products purchased in your store, bringing user-generated content to product detail pages (PDPs).

This solution supports star ratings, review listing, filtering, and sorting options, enabling authenticated users to leave feedback. 

Currently, this feature provides the following characteristics:

- **Authentication required:** Only logged-in customers can submit reviews. Anonymous reviews aren’t supported at this time.
- **Reviews management:** Customers cannot access, edit, or delete their reviews after submission.
- **Automatic approval:** All reviews are automatically approved and published without moderation after submission.
- **My Account integration:** Reviews are final and unavailable for further management by shoppers through the My Account interface.

## Before you begin

Ensure your store uses the latest version of the `faststore/core` package. Follow the steps below to update the package:

Run the following command:

```bash
yarn add @faststore/core@latest
```

Run `yarn dev` to sync the changes to your project.

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Enabling `reviewsAndRatings`

1. Open the `discovery.config.js` file in your project.
2. Set the `reviewsAndRatings` field to **true**.

 ```javascript discovery.config.js
 module.exports = {
   reviewsAndRatings: true,
 }
 ```

 >ℹ️ New stores have this feature enabled by default. To disable, go to the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file and set the `reviewsAndRatings` field to **false**.

### Step 2 - Syncing FastStore project with Headless CMS

Run the `faststore cms-sync` command to sync the `cms` folder of your FastStore project with the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview).

The expected response is that you receive the message `CMS synced successfully...`. The native components of the Reviews and Ratings feature will be automatically updated.

### Step 3 - Adding `ReviewsAndRatings` section

The `ReviewsAndRatings` section displays customer feedback and product ratings.

1. Access your VTEX Admin and go to **Storefront > Headless CMS > Global Sections**.
2. In the Sections tab, click `+` to open a modal with a list of section options.
3. Search for the **ReviewsAndRatings** section and click on it to add.
4. Click `Save` to save your changes.
5. Click `Publish` to open a dropdown list with the options `Add to Release`, to schedule the update, and `Publish now`, to publish immediately. Choose the most suitable option for your scenario.

### Step 4 - [Optional] Customizing Reviews and Rating

To customize your component, see the [List of Native Sections and Overridable Components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections#reviews-and-ratings) to check the components that can be overridden.
