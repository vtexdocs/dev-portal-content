excerpt: "Learn how to use the VTEX IO Messages builder."
---

The `messages` builder handles the internationalization (i18n) of strings in VTEX IO apps using [React](https://react.dev/). Instead of declaring static strings in frontend components, this builder allows you to use an ID for each message, which will be dynamically replaced with the corresponding string in the user's language.

For more information about creating apps that support multiple languages, see [7. Translating the component in the Storefront apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-8-translating-the-component) and [Internationalization](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-multi-language-stores).

## Folder structure

The `messages` builder uses a folder named `messages` located in the app's root folder. This folder contains one JSON file for each language used in the app. Each file is named using the corresponding two lowercase letters of the language's [ISO 639-1 code](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php). For instance, English is represented by the code `en`, Spanish by `es`, and Portuguese by `pt`.

  ```txt
  messages
  ‚î£ üìÑen.json
  ‚î£ üìÑes.json
  ‚îó üìÑpt.json
  ```

- `{language-code}.json`: JSON file of the language containing the message IDs with their corresponding strings. See file name examples below:

  - `en.json`: JSON file for English messages.
  - `es.json`: JSON file for Spanish messages.
  - `pt.json`: JSON file for Portuguese messages.

## Usage

To develop an app using the `messages` builder, follow the steps below:

1. **Start with a React app**: First, you need an app that uses the [`react` builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-react-builder). If you are starting from scratch, you can download the [React app boilerplate](https://github.com/vtex-apps/react-app-template/tree/master/react).
2. **Add the React i18n libraries**: Open a terminal in the `react` folder of your app and run the following command: `yarn add react-intl@3 && yarn add @types/react-intl@3 --dev`.
3. **Configure the manifest**: Access the `manifest.json` file and add the `messages` builder to the builders list.

    ```diff manifest.json
    {
      ...
      "builders": {
      "react": "3.x",
      "docs": "0.x",
    + "messages": "1.x"
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

4. **Add the message identifiers:** Use the string identifiers in your React code. In the example below, `store/my-app.hello` is a string identifier for the `<Formatted Message>` component. Keys that start with `store/` are used in the storefront, while keys that start with `admin/` are used in the Admin UI. If a string identifier is used in the code and does not have a corresponding key in the message JSON files, it will fallback to the [automatic translation service](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-multi-language-stores#automatic-translations).

    ```typescript
    import React from 'react'
    import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl'

    const HelloWorld = () => {
      return (
      <div>
        <FormattedMessage id="store/my-app.hello"/>
      </div>
      )
    }

    export default HelloWorld
    ```

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è Use meaningful and descriptive keys for all strings. Maintain a consistent naming convention that reflects the context and location of the text. This practice helps developers and translators locate the keys, understand their meaning, and organize the strings.

5. **Add the messages files with strings:** Create a separate JSON file for each language in the `messages` folder. In each file, define an object where the keys are the message IDs and the values are the corresponding strings in the target language. Each key must be present in every JSON file. See the examples below for English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

    ```json en.json
    {
      "store/my-app.hello": "Hello, world!"
    }
    ```

    ```json es.json
    {
      "store/my-app.hello": "¬°Hola, mundo!"
    }
    ```

    ```json pt.json
    {
      "store/my-app.hello": "Ol√°, mundo!"
    }
    ```

    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è We recommend adding the keys to the JSON files in alphabetical order. This helps developers and translators to locate and work with the keys.
