FastStore WebOps introduces secret-specific permission controls, allowing project administrators to define exactly which roles can view, edit, or delete secrets. This change provides merchants with enhanced control over sensitive information and helps ensure compliance with internal policies.

The new permissions system is available to all FastStore accounts using WebOps.

## What has changed?

Previously, any user with [FastStore WebOps dashboard](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard) access could create, view, edit, or delete secrets.

Now, access is role-based through License Manager:
* Configuration screens and actions are only enabled if the user's assigned role grants resources to View Secrets or Edit Secrets.
* Users with limited roles will see actions disabled or access restricted as per their permissions.

## Why did we make this change?

The role-based permission system for secrets was developed to:
* Ensure compliance with industry and internal security policies.
* Reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized exposure of credentials.
* Provide traceable audit logs for secret changes.

## What needs to be done?

Only users with the required permissions can view and manage secrets. To guarantee a user has these permissions, check if their VTEX user profile includes a role with the following [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3):
* **Product:** FastStore
* **Category:** Secrets
* **Resources:** *View Secrets* and/or *Edit Secrets*
