When running VTEX IO CLI commands, e.g., `vtex link`, the following message may show up in the terminal:

```txt
error: API: 500 Internal Server Error
```

This means an internal error and VTEX is working to fix it.

## Solution

Nothing can be done on the user side to fix the error. Below are some recommended instructions you can use in this situation:

* Try to run the command again
* Check the VTEX status page
* Contact VTEX Support

### Try to run the command again

Wait some time and try rerunning the command to verify if the error was fixed.

### Check the VTEX status page

If the error is related to an incident in the platform, it will be notified on the [VTEX status page](https://status.vtex.com/).

### Contact VTEX Support

If the error persists after some time, reach out to [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).
