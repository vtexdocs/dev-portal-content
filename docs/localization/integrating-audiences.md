## Integration connection

> ðŸ“˜ The integration connection will occur through:
> 
> - Periodic audience delivery as agreed between parties
> - Delivery to our S3 (access credentials must be requested from your Newtail contact)
> - Files must be sent in `Parquet` format with `Snappy` compression
> - Newtail will provide S3 credentials

> ðŸš§ Delivery recommendation
> 
> In the initial integration, it is essential that all data be sent. This data can be sent in multiple files (depending on the database size. A good number is 1 million rows per file).
> 
> After the first integration, ideally only the delta of rows that have been modified should be sent.

Files must be written following this directory pattern:

```
PREFIX/audiences/YYYY/mm/dd/TIMESTAMP.parquet.snappy
```

| Attribute | Description                                              | Example    |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| PREFIX    | The prefix will be provided by Newtail                  | xyz        |
| YYYY      | Generation year with 4 digits                           | 2023       |
| mm        | Generation month with two digits (January = 01, December = 12) | 09         |
| dd        | Generation day with two digits (from 01 to 31)          | 31         |
| TIMESTAMP | Timestamp is the number of seconds since 1970 (filename can be anything, timestamp is just a suggestion that will never repeat) | 1694812122 |

### Attributes

Most attributes are not required; however, the more complete this information is, the better the relevance will be.

> ðŸ“˜ Columns are case sensitive
> 
> Keep the column names exactly as they are presented.

### Field hashing

Confidential data must be encrypted before being sent using the SHA256 algorithm.

- EMAIL_HASHED
- PHONE_HASHED
- SOCIAL_ID_HASHED
- FIRST_NAME_HASHED
- LAST_NAME_HASHED

> ðŸ“˜ Before generating data hash, you must remove all SPACES and convert values to **LOWERCASE**.

> ðŸš§ For the PHONE_HASHED attribute, you must format it to the E.164 standard and include the country calling code.

#### E.164 format

1. Remove all non-numeric characters, such as spaces, dashes, parentheses, and symbols.
2. Add the country code with a plus sign (+) at the beginning. The country code is a 1 to 3-digit code that identifies the country of the phone number. You can find a list of country codes in the ISO 3166-1 standard.
3. Add the area code (if applicable) without the leading zero. For example, in the United States, the area code consists of three digits and should not start with zero.
4. Include the local phone number without the leading zero (if applicable).

Examples:

- A United States phone number with area code 212 and local number 555-1234 would be formatted as: +12125551234
- A Brazilian phone number with area code 11 and local number 98765-4321 would be formatted as: +5511987654321

#### Creating a hash of a formatted attribute using Python

```python
import re
import hashlib

hash_obj = hashlib.sha256()

def create_hash(x):
    cleaned = re.sub('\s+', '', x.lower())
    hash_obj.update(cleaned.encode('utf-8'))
    return hash_obj.hexdigest()

create_hash(' Allan ') #=> 8c01ade3cb71d3ac7c718ed5a0c565155a4c05a216d9e59013c5d7b49e916914
```
