When attempting to integrate an external search provider with the VTEX Platform as described in the guide [Implementing a Custom Search Resolver App](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/external-search-provider-recipe), you may encounter "Unknown errors" that prevent successful integration.

These errors may occur due to outdated dependencies in your app.

## Solution

To fix any "Unknown errors" during search integration, follow these steps:

### Step 1 - Update the `vtex.search-graphql` dependency version

Make sure the `vtex.search-graphql` dependency in your `node/package.json` file is up-to-date with the latest version of the `vtex.search-graphql` app.

1. Open your app directory and go to the `node/package. json` file.
2. Locate the `vtex.search-graphql` dependency.
3. Compare the version listed in your `node/package.json` with the [latest version available for the `vtex.search-graphql` app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/search-graphql/blob/master/manifest.json#L4).
4. If your `vtex.search-graphql` dependency is outdated, update it to the latest version.

    a. Edit the `node/package. json` file, updating the version number for `vtex.search-graphql`.

    b. Save the changes to the `node/package. json` file.

### Step 2 - Install updated dependencies

After updating the `vtex.search-graphql` version, install the update dependencies:

1. Open a terminal and go to your app's `node` folder.
2. Run the following command to install the updated dependencies:

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

### Step 3 - Re-link the app

After installing the updated dependencies, re-link the app to apply the changes. Run the following command:

```sh
vtex link
```
