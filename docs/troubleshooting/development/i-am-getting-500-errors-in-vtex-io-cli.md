When running VTEX IO CLI commands, e.g., `vtex link`, the following message may be displayed in the terminal:

```txt
error: API: 500 Internal Server Error
```

This means an internal error occurred, and VTEX is working to fix it.

## Solution

No action is required from the user to fix the error. Below are some recommended instructions you can use in this situation:

- Try running the command again
- Check the VTEX Status page
- Contact VTEX Support

### Try running the command again

Wait some time and try running the command again to check if the error was fixed.

### Check the VTEX Status page

If the error is related to a platform incident, it will be published on the [VTEX Status page](https://status.vtex.com/).

### Contact VTEX Support
