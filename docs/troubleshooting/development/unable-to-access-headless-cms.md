If you encounter the error `Error: Permission denied` or `Error: User indicated by VtexIdclientAutCookie is not authorized to access the indicated resource` when using `faststore cms-sync` or `vtex cms sync`, this issue is related to the user permissions needed to execute the command and save resources.

## Solution

To solve this problem, ask the user who granted your user Admin access to follow the steps below:

### Granting user Admin access

1. Open the VTEX Admin and go to **Account Settings > User Roles.**

2. Under **Roles**, select the role associated with the user requesting CMS permissions. For example, **Owner (Admin Super)**.

3. In **Products and Resources**, find and click **CMS**.

4. Make sure both **See CMS menu on the top-bar** and **Settings** are checked.

5. Navigate to the **Users** section and add the email of the user who needs access to the CMS.

6. Click `Save`. Ask the user who requested access to run the `faststore cms-sync` or `vtex cms sync` command again. They should now be able to sync their changes.
