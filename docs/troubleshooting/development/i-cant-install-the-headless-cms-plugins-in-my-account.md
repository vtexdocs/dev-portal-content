If you are a Windows user, you may encounter the following error after [installing the Headless CMS plugin](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-1-configuring-the-vtex-account#step-1-setting-up-the-command-line-environment):

```sh
vtex plugins install cms
warning "@vtex/cli-plugin-cms > @vtex/api > apollo-server-core > apollo-graphql@0.9.5" has incorrect peer dependency "graphql@^14.2.1 || ^15.0.0".
Installing plugin @vtex/cli-plugin-cms... failed
    Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, symlink
    'C:\Users\LukeSkywalker\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\vtex' ->
    'C:\Users\LukeSkywalker\AppData\Local\vtex\node_modules\vtex'
    Code: EPERM
```

To solve this issue, enable [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers) in your machine.
FastStore projects rely on creating symbolic links (symlinks), and this mode grants the necessary permissions and privileges to use them, which reduces the probability of encountering errors during development.

> ⚠️ Running the FastStore project as an Administrator is not recommended.

1. To enable Developer Mode, refer to Microsoft's official guide [Enable your device for development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers).

2. After enabling Developer Mode, launch Windows Terminal and run `vtex cms`. This will allow the system to create the necessary symlinks for running commands from the Headless CMS plugin.
