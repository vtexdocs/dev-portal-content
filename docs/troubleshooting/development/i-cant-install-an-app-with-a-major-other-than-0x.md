If you are unable to install an app with a major [version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-releasing-a-new-app-version#understanding-app-versioning) other than `0.x`, follow the instructions below.

## Solution

Run `vtex ls` to check which apps are included on the [Edition App](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) installed on your account. If you see the app you are trying to install with another major, you might have an issue with the Edition App installed on your account.

In this case, consider [opening a support ticket](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) to request a change to the Edition App installed on your account. See the [Edition App](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) article to learn more about the available Edition Apps.
