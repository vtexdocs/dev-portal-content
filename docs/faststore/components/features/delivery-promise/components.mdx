>ℹ This feature is in closed beta, meaning that only selected customers can access it. If you're interested in implementing it, please contact our [Support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us) team.

This guide provides an overview of the [Delivery Promise](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/delivery-promise-overview) components for FastStore. You will understand the purpose of each component, how they function, and where they are located within the FastStore architecture. This knowledge will help you effectively implement and customize the Delivery Promise feature in your store.

>⚠️ To learn how to implement Delivery Promise in your store, see the guide [Implementing Delivery Promise](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/delivery-promise-implementation).

## Components

Delivery Promise introduces a set of modular components and hooks. These are organized within the FastStore core and UI packages and inserted into key sections. This guide focuses on the core components provided by the `@faststore/core` package, which are included by default in the FastStore source code, such as those found in the FastStore starter. Learn more about the packages in [Understanding the project structure](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson).

Below are the core components related to the Delivery Promise feature in FastStore.

### RegionButton

`RegionButton` is a desktop-only component integrated into the `NavBar` section, under the [Global Sections content type](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview#content-types) in the Headless CMS.

Its behavior is context-dependent:

- If a shopper hasn't added a postal code, a `Popover` is displayed, and the button label adjusts based on whether a default postal code is present.
- If a postal code is set, the button shows the location and suppresses the `Popover`.
- When a shopper sets their location, the [`RegionModal`](#regionmodal) component is triggered.

![RegionButton](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/region-button___ccb03f5e9e36d837a4b03aae6a0a58ff.png)

If you have customized the `NavBar`, you can still use the native `RegionButton` by integrating it into your custom `NavBar` component. However, depending on your customization, you may need to implement your own version of `RegionButton`.

This component leverages the following:

* **UI Components:** [`Button`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-button) and [`Icon`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-icon).
* **Hooks:** `useSession`

### RegionModal

`RegionModal` is a component that serves as a section under the Global Sections content type in the Headless CMS. It contains logic to enforce mandatory location entry if specified in the `discovery.config.js` file, which means that the modal cannot be closed without providing a location. It checks for valid postal codes and verifies product availability for the given location.

This component leverages the following:

* **UI Components:** [`RegionModal`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-region-modal)
* **Hooks:** `useRegion`

### RegionBar

`RegionBar` is a mobile-only component that acts as a section under the Global Sections content type in the Headless CMS.

Its behavior is context-dependent:

- If a shopper hasn't added a postal code, a `Popover` is displayed, and the button label adjusts based on whether a default postal code is present.
- If a postal code is set, the button shows the location and suppresses the `Popover`.
- When a shopper sets their location, the [`RegionModal`](#regionmodal) component is triggered.

![RegionBar](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/regionbar80___52615261c9d206fd8e305d92751c00b5.png)

Even if you have customized the `NavBar`, you can still use the native `RegionBar` component to enable Delivery Promise.

This component leverages the following:

* **UI Components**: [`RegionBar`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-region-bar)
* **Hooks:** `useSession`

### RegionPopover

`RegionPopover` is a component that serves as a section under the Global Sections content type in the Headless CMS. When a default postal code is set in the `discovery.config.js` file, the location data (city and postal code) is displayed in a `Popover`.

![RegionPopover](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/regionpopover___dedb0aad756657e71d4c8d40cb2ef5e7.png)

If you have customized `RegionBar` or `RegionButton`, you can still use the native `RegionPopover` by integrating it into your custom components. However, depending on your customization, you may need to implement your own version of `RegionPopover`.

This component leverages the following:

* **UI Components**: [`Icon`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-icon), [`InputField`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-input-field), [`Link`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-link), and [`Popover`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-popover).
* **Hooks:** `useSession`, `useRegion`

### RegionSlider

The `RegionSlider` component enables shoppers to manage their delivery-related location settings and pickup point filters in the Product Listing Pages (PLPs) or search pages. This component is implemented as a Global Section, making it available throughout the store. It is compatible with mobile and desktop browsers.

It includes three interaction types: setting a new location (when no postal code is set); changing an existing location (when a postal code is set); and selecting a pickup point (for filtering) to refine delivery options.

* **No postal code set:** The user clicks the `Set location` button, and the `RegionSlider` appears, allowing the user to set a postal code.

![setLocation](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/set-location___8887a7be647d76a0584e1b977233a672.png)

* **Postal code set:** The user clicks the postal code link, and the `RegionSlider` appears, allowing the user to change the location.

![changeLocation](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/change-location___ada68e0df1bac1e8a20abc9040dbf82f.png)

* **Pickup point filter:** The user applies or clears filters related to pickup points. When filters are cleared, the `RegionSlider` resets its state and removes selected pickup points without closing the component.

* **UI Components:** [SlideOver](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-slide-over)
* **Hooks:** `useRegion` and `useDeliveryPromise`

### FilterDesktop

`FilterDesktop` is a desktop-only component integrated into the `ProductGallery` section, under the Global Sections content type in the Headless CMS. It adds a delivery-based filter option that combines all search and PLP filters.
