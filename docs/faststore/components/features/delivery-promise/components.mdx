title: "Delivery Promise components"
---

This guide explains the components of the [Delivery Promise](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/delivery-promise-overview) feature for FastStore. It describes the structure of these parts and highlights the customizations needed when modifying standard sections like `NavBar` and `ProductGallery`. 

You'll learn which components can be reused and which require customization, illustrating the connection between native implementation and customization.

## Components

Delivery Promise introduces a set of modular components and hooks. These are structured in the FastStore core and UI packages, and are inserted into key sections. This guide focuses on the core components provided by the `@faststore/core` package, which are included by default in the FastStore source code, including the FastStore starter. Learn more about the packages in [Understanding the project structure](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson).

Below are the core components related to the Delivery Promise feature in FastStore.

### RegionButton

`RegionButton` is a desktop-only component integrated into the `NavBar` section, under the [Global Sections content type](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview#content-types) in the Headless CMS.

Its behavior is context-dependent, meaning if a shopper doesn't add a postal code, a `Popover` is displayed, and the button label adjusts based on whether a default postal code is present. If a postal code is added, the button shows the location and suppresses the `Popover`. Additionally, when a shopper sets their location, the [`RegionModal`](#regionmodal) component is triggered.

If you have customized the `NavBar`, you must also customize the `RegionButton` component to use Delivery Promise.

This component leverages the following:

* **UI Components:** [`Button`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-button)  and [`Icon`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-icon).
* **Hooks:** `useSession`

### RegionModal

`RegionModal` is a component that serves as a section under the Global Sections content type in the Headless CMS. It contains logic to enforce mandatory location entry if specified in the `discovery.config.js` file, which means the modal cannot be closed without providing a location. It checks for valid postal codes and verifies product availability for the given location.

If you have customized the `NavBar`, you must also customize the `RegionModal` component to use Delivery Promise.

This component leverages the following:

* **UI Components:** [`RegionModal`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-region-modal)
* **Hooks:** `useRegion`

### RegionBar

`RegionBar` is a mobile-only component that acts as a section under the Global Sections content type in the Headless CMS.

Its behavior is context-dependent, meaning if a shopper doesn't add a postal code, a `Popover` is displayed, and the button label adjusts based on whether a default postal code is present. If a postal code is added, the button shows the location and suppresses the `Popover`. Additionally, when a shopper sets their location, the [`RegionModal`](#regionmodal) component is triggered.

Even if you have customized the `NavBar`, you can still utilize the native `RegionBar` component to use Delivery Promise.

This component leverages the following:

* **UI Components**: [`RegionBar`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-region-bar)
* **Hooks:** `useSession`

### RegionPopover

`RegionPopover` is a component that serves as a section under the Global Sections content type in the Headless CMS. When a default postal code is set in the `discovery.config.js` file, the location data (city and postal code) is displayed in a `Popover`.

![RegionPopover](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/regionpopover___dedb0aad756657e71d4c8d40cb2ef5e7.png)

If you have customized `RegionBar` or `RegionButton`, you must also customize the `RegionPopover` component to use Delivery Promise.

This component leverages the following:

* **UI Components**: [`Icon`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-icon), [`InputField`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-input-field), [`Link`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-link), and [`Popover`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-popover).
* **Hooks:** `useSession`, `useRegion`

### RegionSlider

The `RegionSlider` component enables shoppers to manage their delivery-related location settings and pickup point filters in the Product Detail Pages (PLPs) or search pages. This component is implemented as a Global Section, making it available throughout the store. It works on mobile and desktop browsers.

It includes three interaction types: Setting a new location (no postal code set), changing an existing location (postal code set), and selecting a pickup point (pickup point filter) for more precise delivery options.

* **No postal code set:** The user clicks the "Set location" button, then the `RegionSlider` appears to set a postal code.

* **Postal code set:** The user clicks the postal code link, then the `RegionSlider` appears to change location.

* **Pickup point filter:** The user applies or clears filters related to pickup points. When filters are cleared, the `RegionSlider` resets its state and removes selected pickup points without closing the component.

* **Hooks:** `useRegion` and `useDeliveryPromise`

### FilterDesktop

`FilterDesktop` is a desktop-only component integrated into the `ProductGallery` section, under the Global Sections content type in the Headless CMS. It adds a delivery-based filter option that aggregates all search and PLP filters.
