>⚠️ This is an experimental feature.

In this guide, you'll learn how to enable the experimental **My Account** feature in your store.

**My Account** is a crucial component for any ecommerce website, as it allows customers to manage their personal information, track order history, update security settings, and perform other account-related actions.

>ℹ️ Unlike the previous version of the My Account, which was based on the [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) platform and accessed through a subdomain configured in the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file, this FastStore-based setup allows you to build and manage **My Account** directly within FastStore. 

For details on the previous version, refer to [Integration the VTEX Order Placed and My Account](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-4-integrating-the-vtex-order-placed-and-my-account). While that article discusses the Order Placed page, the experimental feature covered in this guide is solely related to the My Account section.

## Default My Account pages

My Account includes several default pages that are essential for managing a customer's account.

- `src/pages/account/orders/[id].tsx`: Displays individual order details, including items, quantities, prices, and statuses.
- `src/pages/account/user-details.tsx`: Displays the user’s personal information, such as name, email, and contact details.
- `src/pages/account/security.tsx`: Displays security settings, including password management.
- `src/pages/account/profile.tsx`: Displays editable profile settings, allowing users to update personal information.
- `src/pages/account/orders/index.tsx`: Display a list of all past and current orders placed by the user, including summary details for each.

## Before you begin

Make sure you’re using `@faststore/cli` version `3.0.0` or above.  If it’s not updated, see [Updating the `@faststore/cli` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-cli-package-version).

## Instructions

To enable the experimental **My Account** feature in your project, follow the steps below:

1. Open the `discovery.config.js` file.
2. Add the `experimental` object and set the `enableFaststoreMyAccount` value to `true`:

    ```js discovery.config.js mark=2
    experimental: {
          enableCypressExtension: true,
    }
    ```

With the `enableFaststoreMyAccount` flag set to `true`, users accessing the `/account` path will be redirected to the `/account/profile` page.

>⚠️ The `enableFaststoreMyAccount` flag overrides the URL specified in the [`accountUrl`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options#accounturl) property of the `discovery.config.js` file. If the flag is not set or set to `false`, users will be redirected to the URL configured in the `accountUrl` property.

Now that you have the experimental **My Account** enabled in your project, you can extend this feature by following the guide [Extending My Account](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/my-account-extensions).
