To enable access to shopper information in My Account pages, such as the data displayed in the **Ordered by** card on the order details page and the shopper filters on the order list page, you need to configure the appropriate permissions and API credentials.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have [enabled the My Account feature](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/my-account-overview) in your B2B FastStore project.

## Step 1: Creating a Role with Dynamic Storage permissions

1. Access the VTEX Admin, go to **Account Settings > User Roles**.
2. Create a new role or edit an existing one by adding the **Dynamic Storage** product to the role.

3. Under **Resources**, select the **Read only documents** permission.
4. Save the role.

## Step 2: Generating an API Key

After creating the role, you need to generate an API key to authenticate FastStore's server-side requests to VTEX services. This API key will be used by your FastStore project to securely fetch Shopper entity data from Dynamic Storage.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Account > API Keys**.
2. In the **Generated** tab, click `Generate Key`.
3. Complete the fields with the following:

    |Field name | Description | Value example |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----- |
    | Key identification | Name that identifies the key | `FS SHOPPER API KEY` |
    | Roles | Select one or more roles for the key | Select the role created in Step 1, `FS shopper entity` |

4. Click `Generate`.

>⚠️ After generating the API Key, the **App Key** and **App Token** will be displayed only once in the interface. Copy and securely save both credentials immediately, as you'll need them in the next step.

## Step 3: Adding credentials to your project

You need to add the API credentials to your project using environment variables. You can add them by [using WebOps secrets](#using-webops-secrets) or, for local development, by [using the `vtex.env` file](#using-env-file-for-local-development).

### Using WebOps secrets

Follow the [Managing Secrets](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/security-managing-secrets) guide to securely store your credentials to your project:

    | Key       | Value       |
    | --------- | ----------- |
    | `FS_DISCOVERY_APP_KEY` | `YOUR_APP_KEY` |
    | `FS_DISCOVERY_APP_TOKEN` | `YOUR_APP_TOKEN` |

>⚠️ Replace `YOUR_APP_KEY` and `YOUR_APP_TOKEN` with the **App Key** and **App Token** credentials you saved in the [previous step](#step-2-generating-an-api-key).

### Using `.env` file for local development

For local testing, you can use the `vtex.env` file as described in the [local development](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/security-managing-secrets#local-development) guide.

1. Create or open the `vtex.env` file in your project root.
2. Add the following environment variables using the credentials from Step 2:

   ```env
   FS_DISCOVERY_APP_KEY=YOUR_APP_KEY
   FS_DISCOVERY_APP_TOKEN=YOUR_APP_TOKEN
   ```

>❗ Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API credentials in public repositories.

Once configured, your My Account pages will have access to Shopper entity data, enabling features like displaying who placed an order and filtering orders by shopper.
