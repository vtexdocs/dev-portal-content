>⚠️ This is an experimental feature available only for B2B stores. For B2C stores, follow the [standard integration guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-4-integrating-the-vtex-order-placed-and-my-account).

This guide provides an overview of the My Account page for B2B stores.

**My Account** is a crucial component for any ecommerce website, as it allows customers to manage their personal information, track order history, update security settings, and perform other account-related actions.

## Default My Account pages

My Account includes several default pages that are essential for managing a customer's account. The following table describes the file path and purpose of each page:

| Page path | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/orders/[id].tsx` | Displays individual order details, including items, quantities, prices, and statuses. |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/user-details.tsx` | Displays the user's personal information, such as name, email, and contact details. |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/security.tsx` | Displays security settings, including password management. |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/profile.tsx` | Displays editable profile settings, allowing users to update personal information. |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/orders/index.tsx` | Displays a list of all past and current orders placed by the user, including summary details for each. |

### Orders

The orders page lists past and current orders with key details, filters, and links to full order information.

#### Orders page filtering

The orders page features filtering capabilities that allow users to quickly find specific orders. By default, the following filter options are available:

- **Approvals assigned to me:** Toggle filter that shows only orders requiring user approval. When active, the filter state is reflected in the URL as `?pendingApproval=true`, and an `Approvals assigned to me` tag appears below the search bar.

- **Status:** Filter orders by their current status, such as Order Placed, Payment Pending, Invoiced, etc.

- **Order date:** Filter orders by created date using initial and final date parameters.
