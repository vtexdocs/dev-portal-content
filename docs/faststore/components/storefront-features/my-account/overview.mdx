>⚠️ This is an experimental feature available only for B2B stores. B2C stores should continue using the [previous version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-4-integrating-the-vtex-order-placed-and-my-account).

In this guide, you'll learn how to enable the experimental **My Account** feature in your B2B FastStore store. By the end of this guide, you will have configured your store to use the new My Account experience, allowing your customers to manage their accounts directly within FastStore.

**My Account** is a crucial component for any ecommerce website, as it allows customers to manage their personal information, track order history, update security settings, and perform other account-related actions.

>⚠️ Unlike the previous version of My Account, which was based on the [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) platform and accessed through a subdomain configured in the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file, the new version uses a FastStore-based setup that allows you to build and manage **My Account** directly within FastStore. **This feature is available only for B2B stores. B2C stores should continue using the previous version**. For details on the previous version, refer to [Integrating VTEX Order Placed and My Account](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-4-integrating-the-vtex-order-placed-and-my-account). While that article discusses the Order Placed page, the experimental feature covered in this guide is solely related to the My Account section.

## Default My Account pages

My Account includes several default pages that are essential for managing a customer's account.

| Page path | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/orders/[id].tsx` | Displays individual order details, including items, quantities, prices, and statuses. |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/user-details.tsx` | Displays the user’s personal information, such as name, email, and contact details. |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/security.tsx` | Displays security settings, including password management. |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/profile.tsx` | Displays editable profile settings, allowing users to update personal information. |
| `src/pages/pvt/account/orders/index.tsx` | Displays a list of all past and current orders placed by the user, including summary details for each. |

## Before you begin

Make sure you're using `@faststore/cli` version `3.0.0` or above.  If the version isn't updated, see [Updating the `@faststore/cli` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-cli-package-version).

## Instructions

To enable the experimental **My Account** feature in your project, follow the steps below:

1. Open the `discovery.config.js` file.
2. Under the `experimental` object, set the `enableFaststoreMyAccount` value to `true`:

    ```js discovery.config.js mark=2
    experimental: {
          enableFaststoreMyAccount: true,
    }
    ```

3. Commit and push your changes to the main branch to deploy the changes to production.

With the `enableFaststoreMyAccount` flag set to `true`, users accessing the `/account` path will be redirected to the `/pvt/account/profile` page.

>⚠️ The `enableFaststoreMyAccount` flag overrides the URL specified in the [`accountUrl`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options#accounturl) property of the `discovery.config.js` file. If the flag isn't set or is set to `false`, users will be redirected to the URL configured in the `accountUrl` property.

Now that the experimental **My Account** feature is enabled in your project, you can extend this feature by following the guide [Extending My Account](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/my-account-extensions).
