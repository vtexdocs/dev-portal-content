>⚠️ This is an experimental feature.

**Live Shopping for FastStore** adds a customizable player on your storefront to transmit [Live Shopping](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U) events. This guide explains how to integrate **Live Shopping** into a [FastStore v1 or v2](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-faststore-versions-and-support-levels) project. After the implementation, you will be able to [configure and manage](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/125yr6jAfwiiz84JP4ppfO) event transmissions via VTEX Admin.

>ℹ️ If you use the latest version of [FastStore](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore), refer to the guide [Implementing Live Shopping for FastStore](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/storefront-features-implementing-live-shopping-for-faststore).

## Before you begin

Before installing **Live Shopping** for [FastStore previous versions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-faststore-versions-and-support-levels), make sure you've installed the Headless CMS on your page to be able to customize it via VTEX Admin, as described in the [FastStore documentation](https://www.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/cms/vtex).

## Getting the Live Shopping app

Follow the steps below:

1. Access [VTEX Live Shopping](https://apps.vtex.com/vtexventures-livestreaming/p) on VTEX App Store. You can also access it via the VTEX Admin through **Apps > App Store > VTEX Live Shopping**.
2. Click `Get app` to install the app. Log in to your VTEX account if necessary.
3. Click `Place order`.
4. Click `Go to install page`.
5. Click `Install`.
6. Agree to the Terms of Service by clicking `Install`.

## Configuring the Live Shopping component

Once you have the **Live Shopping** app on your store project, follow the instructions to integrate the component:

1. [Create the component](#creating-the-component)
2. [Connect the component to the CMS](#connecting-the-component-to-the-cms)
3. [Configure CMS sections](#configuring-cms-sections)

### Creating the component

To create the **Live Shopping** component, follow the steps below:

1. In your FastStore project, go to `src/components/sections`.
2. Create a new folder named `LiveShopping`.
3. Inside this folder, create the following files:

`index.tsx`

```javascript
export { default } from './LiveShopping'
export type { LiveShoppingProps } from './LiveShopping'
```

`LiveShopping.tsx`

```javascript
import Section from '../Section'


export interface LiveShoppingProps {
  script: string
}


function LiveShopping(section: LiveShoppingProps) {
  return (
    section?.script && (
      <Section className="liveshopping__section">
        <div id="nz-player" />


        <script
          key="nz-player-script"
          id="nz-player-script"
          type="module"
          async
          src={`${section?.script}&originOfProducts=faststore`}
        />
      </Section>
    )
  )
}

export default LiveShopping
```

Once you're done, your directory structure should look like the one below:

```
src/
 └── components/
      └── sections/
           └── LiveShopping/
               ├── index.tsx
               └── LiveShopping.tsx
```

### Connecting the component to the CMS

To connect the component to the CMS, follow the steps below:

1. Locate the CMS renderer file (usually `RenderCMS.tsx`).
2. Import the previously created component:

```javascript
import LiveShopping from 'src/components/sections/LiveShopping'
```

3. Add it to the `COMPONENTS` constant, which contains an object with the components related to sections added to the CMS.

```javascript
const COMPONENTS: Record<string, ComponentType<any>> = {
  LiveShopping,
}
```

### Configuring CMS sections

1. Go to `cms/faststore/sections.json`.
2. Edit the `sections.json` file by adding the following schema:

```
{
    "name": "LiveShopping",
    "schema": {
      "title": "LiveShopping",
      "description": "Setting LiveShopping",
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["script"],
      "properties": {
        "script": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Script"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

3. Save changes.
4. For the **Live Shopping** section to be available on your VTEX Admin, sync your CMS by running the command below:

```
vtex cms sync
```

You will be able to add the **Live Shopping** section to the store's CMS:

![add-live-shopping-section-cms](images/live-shopping-faststore-script-for-template.png)

## First Live Shopping event

The first step is to [create an event](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/5WLXGbOSFmxN7QlzOnfGrv) on VTEX Admin. After that, there will be two other moments that will require configuring the CMS:

* **Start the event:** Place the component to show the player on the storefront.
* **End the event:** Delete the component to remove the player.

>❗Be aware that not all **Live Shopping** configurations are available for previous versions of FastStore, as explained in the section [Feature restrictions](#feature-restrictions).

### Placing the component

To place the component on your project, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps > Live Shopping > Events**, or type **Events** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. In the **Action** column, click the arrow button to go to the [Event page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/live-shopping-events--6aGLiqoKG1UoS30f3FFWch).
3. In the **CMS Configuration** section, select the `External template` option in **Script for template**.
4. Copy the `src` attribute value from the `<script>` tag, without the quotation marks.
 
  ![live-shopping-faststore-script-for-template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/refs/heads/main/images/live-shopping-faststore-script-for-template.png)

5. Go to **Storefront > Headless CMS** and add the LiveShopping section to a page.
6. On that page, paste the `src` value you've copied on the **LiveShopping** field.
7. Save changes.
8. Publish the page.

After that, you will be able to [transmit](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/69PX90vv4oDWQ34nnBkiQt) a **Live Shopping** event. If you don't have the expected result, check [Troubleshooting script not rendering](#troubleshooting-script-not-rendering).

### Removing the component

To delete the component from your store, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > Headless CMS**, or type **Headless CMS** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Select the page where you've added the **Live Shopping** Player.
3. On the `Sections` tab, in the **Live Shopping Player** section, click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true"></i> **More > Delete**.
4. Click `Save`.
5. Click **Publish > Publish Now**.
6. (Optional) If the page version had been published before and the **Overwrite Published Version** window opens, click `Overwrite`.

## Feature restrictions

Since the **Live Shopping Player** isn't a native solution for FastStore previous versions, there will be some feature limitations. The recommendations you must follow while [configuring a Live Shopping event](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/125yr6jAfwiiz84JP4ppfO) are listed below:

>❗ Make sure to follow our recommendations on CMS and Settings configurations, as misconfiguration can compromise the transmission of the **Live Shopping** event.

* ❌ **UTM configuration:** Not supported as a native solution, so data tracking isn't available.
* ❌ **Add to Cart configuration:** Not supported as a native solution, but can be used while presenting a different behavior. When the customer clicks `Add to Cart` on the Live Shopping event, instead of adding the product to the cart, it will open the product details page (PDP) in a new tab, from where the customer can add the item to the cart.
* ❌ **Quick View configuration:** Not supported as a native solution and mustn't be activated on the CMS section of the [events page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/live-shopping-events--6aGLiqoKG1UoS30f3FFWch). Otherwise the customer might have cart errors while using the Add to Cart configuration.
* ❌ **Popup transmission configuration:** Not supported as a native solution and mustn't be activated on the [events page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/live-shopping-events--6aGLiqoKG1UoS30f3FFWch). Otherwise it may delete the live event itself. It can be found under the Player configuration on the Settings section.

## Troubleshooting script not rendering

After [placing the Live Shopping component](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/4r5uk6XHxdYlOGMr11GFWR) on your FastStore project, if the **Live Shopping** application does not render or display on the storefront, even though the script appears when inspecting elements, try wrapping the **Live Shopping** script in an iframe instead.

### Alternative `LiveShopping.tsx` (with iframe)

After doing so, when inspecting the elements you should see something like the following example:
