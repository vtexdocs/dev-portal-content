Regionalization is a feature of [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3qgT47zY08biLP3d5os3DG) that optimizes search results according to the availability of sellers in the customer's region.

Regionalization uses a behavior from VTEX Intelligent Search called [Availability](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/7LMQbWK5nElIkXo0NK8Kux). It searches for products available in the inventory of sellers that serve a particular region.

Stores that have more than one registered white-label seller usually have specific inventories for each region. This is the case for supermarkets, for example.

With the Regionalization feature enabled, if a customer enters their Postal Code while browsing the store (before checkout), only products available in the corresponding region will be displayed in the search results.
