## Before you begin

### Install Intelligent Search

Make sure you have Intelligent Search installed, enabled, and integrated with the catalog in your account. To do this, follow the instructions in the following guides:

* [Installing Intelligent Search](https://newhelp.vtex.com/docs/tracks/installing-intelligent-search)   
* [Starting the integration with Catalog](https://newhelp.vtex.com/docs/tracks/starting-the-integration-with-catalog)

### Receive approval for the product recommendations feature

Open a ticket to [VTEX Support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us), requesting the use of the product recommendations feature for your FastStore account.

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Set up your account environment

After you receive the approval to use the product recommendations feature, the VTEX support team will prepare your account environment by: 

* Creating a Synerise workspace for recommendations.  
* Synchronizing your product catalog with the recommendation service.  
* Setting up API keys for secure access.  
* Generating a custom integration script for your store.

### Step 2 - Implement the script in the FastStore project

To collect shopper product interaction events for training and delivering recommendations, implement the script provided by VTEX Support as a third-party script in your FastStore project. To do this, follow these instructions:

1. Add a new section that can fetch products, track views, and click events. One example is creating a `RecommendationShelf` that displays products in a carousel. For instructions on how to create this component, refer to the [Creating a RecommendationShelf section](/TBD).

	> ⚠️ After creating this new section, you can add it to any part of the store, including Home, PDP, and PLP.

2. Add the script provided by VTEX Support as a third-party script in your FastStore project. To add the script, follow the instructions in the [Adding third-party scripts](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/storefront-features-handling-third-party-scripts) guide.  
3. Save the `_snrs_uuid` in the user's order form, so that when the order is placed, it is possible to attribute that sale to the user identified during navigation. When the ID is generated, it is necessary to save the user's ID in the orderForm during navigation using `PUT` Set multiple custom field values as shown below:


    ```
    fetch(`/api/checkout/pub/orderForm/${orderForm.id}/customData/synerise`, {
        method: 'PUT',
        body: JSON.stringify({
        uuid: snrsUuidCookie,
        source: isMobile() ? 'WEB_MOBILE' : 'WEB_DESKTOP',
        }),
    })

    ```

To validate that it worked, make a request to retrieve the `orderForm` using `GET` [Get current cart](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/checkout-api#get-/api/checkout/pub/orderForm). The `customData` field returned should contain the added information.

5. Send the `POST` [Product View](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/recommendations-bff-api#post-/api/recommend-bff/events/product-view/v2) event following the API reference.

### Step 3 - Train the models

Once the tracking script collects enough browser data, the VTEX team will train and configure the recommendation models for each strategy.  
The available strategies are:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Best sellers | Returns the top-selling or most popular items in the store. |
| Recommended for you | Provides recommendations tailored to the user's profile and behavior. |
| Similar products | Returns items similar to a specified product. |
| Buy together | Suggests complementary items to a specified product. |
| Recently viewed | Returns the most recently viewed products for the given user. |
| Visually similar products | Returns visually similar items to a specified product. |
| Manual collection | Returns recommendations from a collection defined manually. |
| Next interaction | Predicts and suggests products the user is likely to interact with next. |

After the models are trained, they will be available for API-based recommendation displays in your store.

### Step 4 - Integrate product recommendations

Once models for each selected strategy are trained, you can integrate product recommendations into your store and display them during shopper interactions by following these steps in order:

1. [Managing user session](#managing-user-sessiosn)  
2. [Implementing recommendation strategy](#implementing-recommendation-strategy)  
3. [Tracking user interactions with the recommendations](#tracking-recommendation-events).

#### Managing user session

Use the `POST` [Start Session](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/recommendations-bff-api#post-/api/recommend-bff/users/start-session/v2) endpoint to create a unique user ID for recommendations. This endpoint:

* Generates a unique user ID (`recommendationsUserId`) for the session.  
* Links it to the provided order form ID.  
* Stores the ID in the `vtex-rec-user-id` cookie for session continuity.  
* Initializes recommendation tracking and personalization.

>ℹ️ Call this endpoint on the first page view of each visit, before displaying any recommendations, and only if the `_snrs_uuid` is not already present. If `orderFormId` is not provided in the request body, the API attempts to retrieve it from the `checkout.vtex.com` cookie.

**Request example**:

```
curl --request post \
  --url https://api.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/recommend-bff/v2/users/start-session \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'host: apiexamples.vtexcommercestable.com.br' \
  --header 'x-forwarded-host: www.apixamples.com' \
  --header 'x-vtex-rec-origin: apiexamples/storefront/vtex.recommendation-shelf@2.x' \
  --data '{"orderFormId":"d761924de4254f6883a8ec2e9a28597d"}'
```

**Response example**:

```json
{
  "recommendationsUserId": "198e0f50-acf8-42f7-998a-5cd125464749"
}
```

Persist the returned `recommendationsUserId` as `_snrs_uuid` and include it in all subsequent requests.

#### Fetching products for the recommendation component

Use the `GET` [Fetch recommendations](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/recommendations-bff-api#get-/api/recommend-bff/recommendations/v2) endpoint to fetch products for each shelf whenever a page contains a recommendation component (homepage, PDP, cart, PLP, etc.).

The campaign determines the type of recommendations returned, such as personalized recommendations, similar items, cross-sell, and others.

This endpoint retrieves a list of recommended products based on:

* Campaign VRN (Virtual Resource Name) identifying the recommendation strategy. The VRN follows the pattern `vrn:recommendations:{store-name}:{campaignType}:{campaignId}`. Contact [our Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) to obtain the `campaignId`.  
    
  Available campaign types:
