>⚠️ This is an experimental feature.

**Live Shopping for FastStore** is a solution to add a customizable player to your storefront to transmit [Live Shopping](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U) events. Once you've implemented the feature, you will be able to [configure and manage](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/125yr6jAfwiiz84JP4ppfO) the event transmission via VTEX Admin.

This guide explains how to integrate **Live Shopping** into a project using [FastStore](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore).

>ℹ️ This feature is available as a native solution for the latest version of FastStore. If your storefront technology is [FastStore v1 or v2](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-faststore-versions-and-support-levels), refer to the guide [Implementing Live Shopping for FastStore previous versions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/implementing-live-shopping-for-faststore-previous-versions).

## Before you begin

Before implementing **Live Shopping for FastStore**, make sure you have onboarded your FastStore project through [WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview).

## Live Shopping app

The first step is to get the **Live Shopping** app by following the steps below:

1. Access [VTEX Live Shopping](https://apps.vtex.com/vtexventures-livestreaming/p) on VTEX App Store. You can also access it via the VTEX Admin through **Apps > App Store > VTEX Live Shopping**.
2. Click `Get app` to install the app. Log in to your VTEX account if necessary.
3. Click `Place order`.
4. Click `Go to install page`.
5. Click `Install`.
6. Agree to the Terms of Service by clicking `Install`.

## Installation

Once you have the app on your store project, install the **Live Shopping** package and its dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add @vtex/faststore-plugin-live-shopping object-hash@3.0.0 p-queue@8.1.0
```

## Configuration

Next, add the plugin reference below to your `discovery.config.js` file:

```javascript
 plugins: ["@vtex/faststore-plugin-live-shopping"]
```	

## CMS sections sync

Once you've added the plugin, synchronize your CMS sections with the following command:

```bash	
yarn faststore cms-sync
```

## First Live Shopping event

The first step is [creating an event](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/5WLXGbOSFmxN7QlzOnfGrv) on VTEX Admin. After that, you will need to place the component to start the event and delete the component to end the event. Learn more:

* **Start the event:** [Place the component](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/4r5uk6XHxdYlOGMr11GFWR) to show the player on the storefront.
* **End the event:** [Delete the component](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/7e3bP6LjFgxXC210jSpl59) to remove the player.
