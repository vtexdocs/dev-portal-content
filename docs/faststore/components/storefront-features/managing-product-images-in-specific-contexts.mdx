In this guide, you will learn how to control the product images that will be displayed in your store sections by labeling them with specific contexts on [VTEX Catalog](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/catalog-overview--77M8ItLhDXs6aBdQTqToVe?&utm_source=autocomplete). These contexts determine where the image is displayed and are defined as follows:

- **Gallery context:** Restricts the image to display only in the Product Image Gallery, allowing you to curate a set of images highlighting key features.
- **SKU selector context:** Restricts the image to display only in the SKU selector, providing a zoomed-in view for detailed examination.
- **Generic context (default):** Sets the image to display in all sections.

For example, you may want to limit the number of images displayed in the Product Details Page (PDP) gallery to highlight key product features.

| **Before** | **After** |
| ---------- | --------- |
| ![before-context](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/before___bec5e5c536162b228cd4d50d0042c4a6.png) | ![after-context](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/after___f6bb9be611ba511d7eee8558c34a2732.png) |
| The product image gallery displays all five images uploaded to [Catalog](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ). | After limiting the number of images, only three product images are displayed to focus on the most important product features. |

By associating images with specific contexts, you ensure only the most relevant images are in the sections.

## Before you begin

To follow the instructions in this guide, you must understand the concepts of [API extensions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-overview) and [Section override](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-overview).

## Instructions

For this tutorial, we will create a custom gallery for the PDP using the [label](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/17PxekVPmVYI4c3OCQ0ddJ#adding-an-image-to-the-sku) feature from [VTEX Catalog](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ).

In this example, we will create a context by labeling selected images with the term `gallery`. This gallery will only display images that have been assigned the `gallery` label in [Catalog](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ).

### Step 1: Labeling images in Catalog

Label your product images with the label field in Catalog.
This label determines where product images should be displayed in your store.
To label your images, follow these steps:

1. Access the VTEX Admin.
2. Go to **Catalog > All Products** and find the product you want to edit.
3. Click the `Update` button and then click `SKU`.

    ![sku-images](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/sku-images-admin___1baaa1f88be16795b892634b80676ccc.gif)

4. Go to the SKU you want to update and click `Edit`.
5. Click the `Images` tab.
6. For each SKU image you want to add to the gallery, set the **Label** field to **gallery**. These are the available labels:

    | Label name | Description |
    | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    | `gallery` | Restricts the image to display only on the Product Image Gallery. |
    | `generic` | Includes the image in all contexts by default. Images labeled as `generic` are always displayed as part of the complete set of images. |
    | `skuvariation` | Assigns the image to the SKU Selector. If no image has this label, the first image of the SKU is used. |

7. Click `Save Label` and `Save`.

### Step 2: Querying images by context

Update your store `ServerProduct` and `ClientProduct` fragments to retrieve images based on their [assigned labels](#step-1-labeling-images-in-catalog). This ensures that only relevant images for specific contexts, like the PDP, are retrieved.

> ℹ️ For more information about fragments in FastStore, see the guide [Extending queries using fragments](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-extending-queries-using-fragments).

1. Open your store code using the code editor of your choice.
2. Go to `src/fragments/ServerProduct.ts` and add the following:

    ```js src/fragments/ServerProduct.ts
    import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'
    
    export const fragment = gql`
    fragment ServerProduct on Query {
        product(locator: $locator) {
        galleryImages: image(context: "gallery", limit: 3) {
            url
            alternateName
        }
        }
    }
    `
    ```

3. Go to `src/fragments/ClientProduct` and add the following:

    ```js src/fragments/ClientProduct
    import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'
    
    export const fragment = gql`
    fragment ClientProduct on Query {
        product(locator: $locator) {
        galleryImages: image(context: "gallery", limit: 3) {
            url
            alternateName
        }
        }
    }
    `
    ```

> ❕The `limit: 3` argument selects only three images. Omitting this argument returns all images labeled `gallery`. By default, all images are returned if no context label is found.


### Step 3: Overriding the `ImageGallery` component

Customize the default [ImageGallery](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-image-gallery) component to showcase the images retrieved in the [previous step](#step-1-labeling-images-in-catalog). This override allows you to control how images are displayed and interacted with on your PDP.

1. In your store code, create the `ProductDetails.tsx` file inside the `src/components/overrides` folder.
2. In the `ProductDetails.tsx` file, add the following content:

    ```tsx
    import { SectionOverride } from "@faststore/core";

    import { usePDP } from "@faststore/core";
    import { Image_unstable as Image } from "@faststore/core/experimental";

    import { ImageGallery, ImageGalleryViewer } from "@faststore/ui";
    import { useState } from "react";

    const SECTION = "ProductDetails" as const;

    const ImageComponent = ({ url, alternateName }: {url: string, alternateName?: string}) => {
    return <Image src={url} alt={alternateName} width={68} height={68}/>
    }

    const override: SectionOverride = {
    section: SECTION,
    components: {
        __experimentalImageGallery: {
        Component: () => {
                const { data } = usePDP();
            const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState<number>(0);
    
            const currentImage = data.product.galleryImages[selectedIndex];

            return (
            <ImageGallery
                images={data.product.galleryImages}
                ImageComponent={ImageComponent}
                selectedImageIdx={selectedIndex}
                setSelectedImageIdx={setSelectedIndex}
                data-fs-product-details-gallery="true"
            >
                <ImageGalleryViewer>
                <Image
                    sizes="(max-width: 360px) 50vw, (max-width: 768px) 90vw, 50vw"
                    width={691}
                    height={691 * (3 / 4)}
                    loading="eager"
                    src={currentImage.url}
                    alt={currentImage.alternateName}
                />
                </ImageGalleryViewer>
            </ImageGallery>
            );
        },
        },
    },
    };

    export { override };
    ```

   - The `ServerProduct` and `ClientProduct` fragments are accessed via the `usePDP` hook.
   - Instead of using the images being passed to the [ImageGallery](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-image-gallery) component, we are using the `galleryImages` we defined.

3. Open a terminal and run `yarn dev` to sync the changes made in the previous steps.
4. Open a pull request to your store with these changes. Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, merge it into the `main` branch.

### Considerations for SKU Selector Images

The FastStore API defines a specific name for images that are supposed to display on the SKU Selector. The first image labeled `skuvariation` in Catalog will automatically display on the SKU Selector. If no image has the `skuvariation` label, the first image of the SKU will be displayed.

> ⚠ If an image needs to display on the SKU Selector and Product Gallery, you must upload it twice and assign different labels.
