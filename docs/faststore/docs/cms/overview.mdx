The CMS is the VTEX content management system designed to provide a set of tools for managing storefront content. It helps with the creation, collaboration, and distribution of content and introduces the following improvements:

- **Performance**: Dedicated read-optimized Data Plane for faster content delivery during store builds.  
- **Reliability**: Event-driven architecture with message queues ensuring no content updates are lost.  
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of content management and content delivery.  
- **Developer experience**: Modular schema files, improved CLI tooling, and better alignment with version control workflows.  

In this track, learn about the architectural and code-level changes when upgrading from the Headless CMS to the CMS. Use this track to evaluate and plan the necessary modifications to your store's codebase during the migration.
