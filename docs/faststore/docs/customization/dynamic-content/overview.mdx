title: 'Dynamic Content'
---

Dynamic Content is a FastStore feature that allows you to customize your store home and landing pages using server-side data fetching.  This feature improves performance and SEO by dynamically displaying fetched data in store sections on these pages.

In the following example, a page slug, `/my-landing-page`, is configured in the store code and included in the Headless CMS. 
The landing page features two Hero sections: a [native one](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-hero) displaying an image added from the Headless CMS, and a custom one with a fixed image sourced directly from an API defined in the store code.

> ℹ️ For other types of pages, such as collections (PLPs) and product pages (PDPs), server-side data fetching is already available via API Extensions. Refer to the [API Extension documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-overview) for more details on fetching data for these pages.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update the `@faststore/core` package

Ensure your store uses `@faststore/core` v3.0.0 or greater. Follow the steps below to update the package:

1. Update your store’s `@faststore/core` package to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add @faststore/core@latest
```

2. Run `yarn dev` to sync the changes to your project.

### Understand Section Override

To work with dynamic content, you need knowledge of [Section Override](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-overview).

</Steps>

## Implementing Dynamic Content

To use the Dynamic Content feature in your home and landing pages, follow these steps:

- [Step 1 - Setting up your store code for Dynamic Content](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/dynamic-content-step-1-setting-up-the-store-code-for-dynamic-content): Request Fetch API or any HTTP library to fetch the data directly ([Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), fetch, etc). 
- [Step 2 - Handling Dynamic Content within custom sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/dynamic-content-step-2-handling-the-dynamic-content-in-custom-sections): Fetch the data using the existing API Extension feature.
