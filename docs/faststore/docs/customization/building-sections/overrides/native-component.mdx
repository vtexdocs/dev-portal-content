title: "Overriding a native component"
---

Now that you know how to [override a component's prop](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-component-props), learn how to override a native component to use a custom component.

For example, you may want to replace the current `BuyButton` component from the `ProductDetails` section to meet your business needs. Currently, when the [`BuyButton`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-buy-button) is clicked, it opens the `CartSideBar` as its default behavior:

    ![overrides-PDP-buy-button-component](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-buy-button-open-cart___a5853a88238fa31610a93e8a1333bb00.gif)

For this guide, we will create a custom BuyButton that displays an `alert` once the user clicks on it.

    > ⚠️ Using overrides does not significantly impact performance. FastStore's handling of props and design tokens is designed for good performance.

## Before you begin

Make sure your `@faststore/core` package has the 3.0.0 version or above. If you need to update
it, refer to this [release note](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Setting up the component file

1. After choosing a native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections), open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Go to the `src` folder, create the `components` folder, and inside it, create the `sections` folder. You can run the following command to create them:

   > ℹ️ The naming of the `sections` folder is arbitrary, as overrides can be created in any file, since the import is made in the `src/components/index.tsx` file.

   <Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
   <Tab>`bash copy mkdir src/components src/components/sections `</Tab>
   <Tab>`bash copy mkdir src\components src\components\sections `</Tab>
   </Tabs>

### Step 2 - Create your custom component

1. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `CustomBuyButton.tsx`.

    <Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
    <Tab>

    ```bash
    touch src/components/CustomBuyButton.tsx
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab>
    ```bash
    type nul > src\components\CustomBuyButton.tsx
    ```
    </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    > ℹ️ When creating a custom component, it's important to choose a name that distinguishes it from the native component. For example, `Custom{ComponentName}` = `CustomBuyButton`.

2. Add the following code into `CustomBuyButton.tsx` file:

        ```tsx
        import React from "react";
        import { Button as UIButton } from "@faststore/ui";

        export function CustomBuyButton() {
            return (
            <UIButton
                variant="primary"
                onClick={() => {
                alert("Hello User!");
                }}
            >
                New Buy Button
            </UIButton>
            );
        }
        ```

### Step 3 - Setting up the custom section

1. In the `sections` folder, create a new file for your customized section. For example, create a new file named `ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx` under the `src/components/sections` directory.
2. Open the `ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx` file and update it with the following code:

        ```tsx
        import {
            ProductDetailsSection,
            getOverriddenSection,
        } from "@faststore/core";
        import { CustomBuyButton } from "./CustomBuyButton";

        const ProductDetailsWithCustomButton = getOverriddenSection({
            Section: ProductDetailsSection,
            components: {
            BuyButton: { Component: CustomBuyButton },
            },
        });

        export default ProductDetailsWithCustomButton;
        ```

#### Step 4 - Overriding the component

1. Choose a component to override from the [list of overridable components of each native section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections). In this example, we are overriding the `BuyButton` component in the `ProductDetails` section.
2. In the `components` folder, if you don't have already the `index.tsx` file, create the file and add the following:

        ```tsx
        import ProductDetailsWithCustomButton from "./sections/ProductDetailsWithCustomButton";

        export default { ProductDetails: ProductDetailsWithCustomButton }
        ```

3. Open the terminal, and run `yarn dev` to sync the new custom component to your store preview.
4. Open the localhost available after running `yarn dev`.
5. Open a PDP and click `New BuyButton`. An alert with `Hello user` message will appear.

### Step 5 - Publishing your changes

If your changes are working locally and you want to publish them in production, follow the steps below:

1. Publish your branch with the custom components files.
2. Open a pull request in the store's GitHub repository.
3. Review the pull request
4. Merge the changes from this branch to the `main` one and the new component will be available in the live store.
