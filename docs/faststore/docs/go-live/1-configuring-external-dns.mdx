In this guide, you will learn how to point your custom domain to your **FastStore** website and configure it in VTEX for a complete setup. The process involves the following steps:

   - Setting up your external DNS provider to point your custom domain to your VTEX website. You can buy custom domains from any **domain registration platform**.
   - Configuring your custom domains in **VTEX Account Settings**.
   - Associating your custom domains with your **FastStore** project.

By the end of this guide, your FastStore website will be accessible via a custom domain, and **VTEX Checkout** will be operational. You will then be ready to configure other VTEX solutions, such as **Order Placed**, **Login**, and **My Account**.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Have your FastStore project

Ensure your FastStore project is created, set up, and customized to meet your business's needs. To start your FastStore project, follow the [Getting Started track](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-overview).

### Purchase the store domain

Purchase the desired domain for your store from a trusted domain registrar.

### Redirect your root domain

To ensure store visitors who access your store without `www` are automatically redirected to the correct address, redirect the root domain to the `www` subdomain. To complete this step, follow the instructions in the [Best practices for accessing the store without www](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-access-without-www--tutorials_4278#root-domain-redirect-without-www) guide.

### Plan your setup in advance

Some steps in this guide, particularly those involving [CDN workflow configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-1-configuring-external-dns#step-6-configuring-the-cdn-workflow-only-for-new-go-lives) and [domain migration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-1-configuring-external-dns#step-8-migrating-the-domain), require assistance from [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support). Processing these requests typically takes up to three business days, followed by approximately five additional days to complete DNS pointing. We recommend planning these steps well in advance to avoid delays in your store’s go-live schedule.

</Steps>

## Instructions

> ⚠️ If you still need to configure other VTEX solutions, please **use a fictitious domain name** while following the steps. Once you have set up all the desired integrations, repeat the instructions using your final domain to make your website publicly available to end users.

### Step 1 - Creating DNS records

1. Access your domain provider's website.
2. Create a **CNAME** DNS record for your `www` domain (for example, `www.mystore.com`) pointing to `www.{rootDomain}.cdn.vtex.com` (for example, `www.mystore.com.cdn.vtex.com`). Check your domain provider's documentation for more information.
3. Now, create a **CNAME** record for the `secure` subdomain (for example, `secure.mystore.com`) pointing to `secure.{rootDomain}.cdn.vtex.com` (for example, `secure.mystore.com.cdn.vtex.com`). This subdomain will be used by the **Checkout**, **Order Placed**, **Login**, and **My Account** pages.

>ℹ️ The configured addresses may not be immediately available to everyone due to DNS propagation, which can take 24–48 hours to complete.

### Step 2 - Putting your account into production

To proceed, make sure your store is active and in production by following the steps in the guide [Putting your account into production](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/go-live-your-store--4Ns5FxIiksmjsdX2yOTduM/7wFsbWgN4rnZsbjhv8IItX#putting-your-account-into-production).

### Step 3 - Configuring domains in VTEX Account Settings

You must set up your VTEX account to use the DNS records created in the previous step.

>ℹ️ For more information about store domain configuration, see the [Configuring the store domain](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-the-store-domain--tutorials_2450) guide.

1. In the VTEX Admin, click your profile avatar, identified by the first letter of your email address.
2. Access **Account Settings > Account**.
3. Go to the **Stores** tab and in the **Hosts** table, click the menu (**⋮**) and choose **Edit**.
4. In the **Hosts** field, add your main domain (for example, `www.mystore.com`) to the list.
5. Click `Add`.
6. Add the `secure` subdomain (for example, `secure.mystore.com`) to the list.
   ![host-configuration](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/account-settings-new___2e13bee3041e8505922a737b94652ca6.png)

7. Also add the root domain. For example, if your domain is `www.mystore.com`, add `mystore.com`. To complete the setup, you must add these three hosts:
   - `www.mystore.com`  (store domain)
   - `mystore.com` (root domain)
   - `secure.mystore.com` (checkout/myaccount subdomain)

> ⚠️ To ensure a seamless checkout experience, all subdomains used by your store must be added to the host list. For more information, see the [Adding subdomains to the host list](#adding-subdomains-to-the-host-list) section.

8. Click the **Save** button.

### Step 4 - Associating your custom domain with your FastStore project

In your FastStore project, you must also configure your project to point to the correct addresses and domains.

1. Open your FastStore project in your preferred code editor.
2. Open the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file.
3. Update the `storeUrl`, `secureSubdomain`, `checkoutUrl`, `loginUrl`, and `accountUrl` properties as follows, replacing the values between curly brackets according to your scenario:

   - **`storeUrl`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}`
   - **`secureSubdomain`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}`
   - **`checkoutUrl`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}/checkout`
   - **`loginUrl`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}/api/io/login`
   - **`accountUrl`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}/api/io/account`

Consider the following example of how this code block would look after configuring a store with the `www.mystore.com` domain and `secure` subdomain:

   ```diff /discovery.config.js
   ...
   
   // Default channel
   channel: '1',
   
   +  // Production URLs
   +  storeUrl: 'https://www.mystore.com',
   +  secureSubdomain: 'https://secure.mystore.com',
   +  checkoutUrl: 'https://secure.mystore.com/checkout',
   +  loginUrl: 'https://secure.mystore.com/api/io/login',
   +  accountUrl: 'https://secure.mystore.com/api/io/account',
   
   // Lighthouse CI
   lighthouse: {
   ...
   ```

4. Save your changes.
5. Open the `vtex.env` file.
6. Add the `SITE_HOST` key with the main domain specified in [Configuring domains in VTEX Account Settings](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-1-configuring-external-dns#step-3---configuring-domains-in-vtex-account-settings) as the value.

   ```diff /vtex.env
   + SITE_HOST=www.mystore.com
   ```

7. Save your changes.
8. Open a pull request, commit your changes, and deploy them to `main`.

> ⚠️ For stores with prefixed domains, add the `subDomainPrefix` property to `discovery.config.js` to ensure product visibility in the secured environment. For more information, see the [Adding `subDomainPrefix` for prefixed domains](#adding-subDomainPrefix-for-prefixed-domains) section. 

### Step 5 - Adding your store domain to FastStore WebOps

To complete the domain configuration, add your store domain to [FastStore WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview).

> ⚠️ FastStore WebOps domain configuration always takes priority over any settings in `discovery.config.js`. We recommend managing all domain configurations through FastStore WebOps to centralize all domain settings in a single source.

1. Access your [FastStore WebOps dashboard](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard).
2. Navigate to the Settings tab.
3. In the **Host** field, choose your store's domain (for example, `www.mystore.com`) from the dropdown list.
4. Click `Add`.

### Step 6 - Configuring the CDN workflow (Only for new go-lives)

If your FastStore website is going live for the first time, [open a ticket with VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) and specify that you need to configure the CDN workflow for your store's secure and main domains.

Include the following information in your ticket:

   - Your VTEX **account name**.
   - The **secure** and **main** domains of your store.

The VTEX team will evaluate your request and take the necessary actions to configure your account's CDN workflow.

### Step 7 - Monitoring the new deployment

After adding your domain to FastStore WebOps, a new deployment will be triggered automatically. Before proceeding to the next step, monitor the deployment progress in the FastStore WebOps dashboard until it is complete.

Check if your domain is configured correctly in the FastStore WebOps environment:

1. Access your FastStore WebOps dashboard.
2. Navigate to the Settings tab.
3. Confirm your domain appears in the **Current Domains** list.

   ![currrent-domains](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/docs/faststore/docs/go-live/current-domains.png)

### Step 8 - Migrating the domain

1. Open a ticket with [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) requesting a **domain migration** for your FastStore WebOps implementation. Please include the following information:
   - VTEX account name
   - Store's domain (for example, `www.mystore.com`)
   - Secure domain (for example, `secure.mystore.com`)
   - Confirmation that you’ve completed all previous steps in this guide.

>⚠️ Open the CDN workflow configuration or domain migration ticket well in advance. We recommend submitting your request at least five business days before the planned go-live date. VTEX Support typically takes up to three business days to process the request, and you will have five additional days to complete the DNS configuration after receiving a successful response.

2. Wait for the VTEX team to process your request and complete the domain migration.

3. Once the migration is complete, test your store to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Configuring custom domain prefixes

To ensure your store operates efficiently, it is important to correctly configure custom domain prefixes for checkout and secure product viewing. You need to configure custom domain prefixes in the following scenarios:

- Stores with multiple subdomains: [Add all the subdomains to the host list](#adding-subdomains-to-the-host-list).
- Stores with prefixed domains: [Add `subDomainPrefix` for prefixed domains](#adding-subdomainprefix-for-prefixed-domains).

### Adding subdomains to the host list

To ensure a seamless checkout experience, all subdomains used by your store must be added to the host list. If the store operates without the `www.` domain, you must include both the `www.` and non-`www.` domains in the hosts' list. 

Stores with custom prefixes, such as `shop.mystore.com`, need to add both the prefix and the main domain (`shop.mystore.com` and `mystore.com`). This guarantees that the checkout process works seamlessly when customers access the store with or without `www.` or any other custom prefix.

### Adding `subDomainPrefix` for prefixed domains

To ensure customers can view products in the secured environment on your store's final domain, add the `subDomainPrefix` property to the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#files) file. 
The `subDomainPrefix` property maintains compatibility between cookies set in the storefront and the secure environment.

To add the `subDomainPrefix` property, follow these steps:

1. Open your FastStore project in a code editor of your preference.
2. Open the `discovery.config.js` file.
3. Navigate to the `api` object and add the following:

   ```js
   // Platform specific configs for API
   api: {
    ...
    subDomainPrefix: ['xxx']
   },
   ```

   > ⚠ Replace `'xxx'` from `subDomainPrefix` property with the actual subdomain prefix (for example, `['b2b']`). If you have multiple prefixes, add them as an array of strings (for example, `['b2b', 'dev']`).

4. Save your changes.
5. Open a pull request, commit your changes, and deploy them to `main`.
