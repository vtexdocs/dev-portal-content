title: '1. Configuring external DNS'
---

In this guide, you will learn how to configure external domains for your **FastStore** and **VTEX** website. The process involves the following steps:

   - Setting up your external DNS provider to point your custom domain to your VTEX website. Custom domains can be purchased from any **domain registration platform**.
   - Configuring your custom domains in **VTEX Account Settings**.
   - Associating your custom domains with your **FastStore** project.

As soon as you complete this guide, your FastStore website will be accessible via a custom domain, and **VTEX Checkout** will also be operational. You will then be ready to continue configuring other VTEX solutions, such as **Order Placed**, **Login**, and **My Account**.

## Before you begin

   - Develop your FastStore project by following the [Getting Started track](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-overview).
   - Deploy your FastStore project.
   - Buy the desired domain.
   - [Redirect the **root domain** to the `www` subdomain.](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-access-without-www--tutorials_4278#root-domain-redirect-without-www)

## Instructions

> ⚠️ If you still need to configure other VTEX solutions, **use a fictitious domain name** while following the steps. Once you have set up all the desired integrations, repeat the instructions using your final domain to make your website publicly available to end users.

### Step 1 - Creating DNS records

1. Access your domain provider's website.
2. Create a **CNAME** DNS record for your `www` domain (e.g., `www.mystore.com`) pointing to `www.{rootDomain}.cdn.vtex.com` (example: `www.mystore.com.cdn.vtex.com`). Check your domain provider's documentation for more information. The configured addresses may not be immediately available to everyone due to DNS propagation, which can take 24-48 hours to complete.

> ⚠️ If your strategy requires additional subdomains (e.g., `b2b.mystore.com`), add them as separate CNAMEs and ensure they are [listed under Hosts](#step3--configuring-domains-in-vtex-account-settings).  

### Step 2 - Putting your account into production

To proceed, make sure your store is active and in production by following the steps in the guide [Putting your account into production](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/go-live-your-store--4Ns5FxIiksmjsdX2yOTduM/7wFsbWgN4rnZsbjhv8IItX#putting-your-account-into-production).

### Step 3 - Configuring domains in VTEX Account Settings

Now, you must set up your VTEX account to use the DNS records created in the previous step.

> ℹ For more information about store domain configuration, see the [Configuring the store domain](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-the-store-domain--tutorials_2450) guide.

1. In the VTEX Admin, click your profile avatar, identified by the first letter of your email address.
2. Access **Account Settings > Account**.
3. Go to the **Stores** tab and in the **Hosts** table, click the menu (**⋮**) and choose **Edit**.
4. In the **Hosts** field, enter your main store domain (e.g., `www.mystore.com`) into the list.
5. Click `Add`.

6. Add the root domain as well (e.g., `mystore.com`).
7. Click the **Save** button.

> ⚠️ To ensure a seamless checkout experience, all subdomains used by your store must be added to the host list. For more information, see the [Adding subdomains to the host list](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-1-configuring-external-dns#adding-subdomains-to-the-host-list) section.

### Step 4 - Associating your custom domain with your FastStore project

In your FastStore project, configure your project to point to the correct addresses and domains.

1. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Open the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file.
3. In the `discovery.config.js` file, update the `Production URLs` field with the new URLs, and replace the `rootDomain` value with your store root domain name. See the example below:
    
   ```js
   ...

   // Production URLs
   storeUrl: "https://www.mystore.com",
   checkoutUrl: "https://www.mystore.com/checkout",
   loginUrl: "https://www.mystore.com/api/io/login",
   accountUrl: "https://www.mystore.com/api/io/account",

   ...
   ```

   > ⚠️ Remove any `secureSubdomain` reference or `secure` host.

4. Save your changes.
5. Open the `vtex.env` file.
6. Add the `SITE_HOST` key with the main store domain as the value specified in [Step 3 - Configuring domains in VTEX Account Settings](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/go-live-1-configuring-external-dns#step-3-configuring-domains-in-vtex-account-settings), for example, `SITE_HOST=www.yourstore.com`
7. Save your changes.
8. Open a Pull Request, commit your changes, and deploy them to `main`.

### Step 5 - Configuring the CDN workflow (Only for new go-lives)

If your FastStore website is going live for the first time, [open a ticket with VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) and specify that you need to configure the CDN workflow for your store's secure and main domains.

Include the following information in your ticket:

   - Your VTEX **account name**.
   - The store's main domain (e.g., `www.mystore.com`).

The VTEX team will evaluate your request and take the necessary actions to configure your account's CDN workflow.

### Step 6 - Adding your store domain to FastStore WebOps

To finish the domain configuration, add your store domain to [FastStore WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/webops-dashboard).

> ⚠️ FastStore WebOps domain configuration always takes priority over any settings in `discovery.config.js`. We recommend managing all domain configurations through FastStore WebOps to centralize all domain settings in a single source.

1. Access your [FastStore WebOps dashboard](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/webops-dashboard).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab.
3. In the **Host** field, choose your store's domain (example: `www.mystore.com`) from the dropdown list.
4. Click `Add`.

   ![adding-host-webops](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/docs/faststore/docs/go-live/adding-host-webops.png)

### Step 7 - Monitoring the new deployment

After adding your domain to FastStore WebOps, a new deployment will be triggered automatically. Before proceeding to the next step, monitor the deployment progress in the FastStore WebOps dashboard until it is completed.

Then, check if your domain is configured correctly in the FastStore WebOps environment:

1. Access your FastStore WebOps dashboard.
2. Navigate to the Settings tab.
3. Confirm your domain appears in the **Current Domains** list.

   ![currrent-domains](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/docs/faststore/docs/go-live/current-domains.png)

### Step 8 - Migrating the domain

1. Open a ticket with [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) requesting a **domain migration** for your FastStore WebOps implementation. Include the following information:
   - VTEX account name
   - Store's domain (example: `www.mystore.com`)
   - Secure domain (example: `secure.mystore.com`)
   - Confirmation that you’ve completed all previous steps in this guide.
2. Wait for the VTEX team to process your request and complete the domain migration.
3. Once the migration is complete, test your store to ensure everything is working properly.

## Configuring custom domain prefixes

To ensure your store operates efficiently, it's important to correctly configure custom domain prefixes for checkout and secure product viewing. Custom domain prefixes must be configured in the following scenarios:

- Stores with multiple subdomains: [Add all the subdomains to the host list](#adding-subdomains-to-the-host-list).
- Stores with prefixed domains: [Add `subDomainPrefix` for prefixed domains](#adding-subdomainprefix-for-prefixed-domains).

### Adding subdomains to the host list

To ensure a seamless checkout experience, all subdomains used by your store must be added to the host list. If the store operates without the `www.` domain, you must include both the `www.` and non-`www.` domains in the host list. 

Stores with custom prefixes, like `shop.mystore.com`, need both the prefix and main domain (`shop.mystore.com` and `mystore.com`) added. This guarantees that the checkout process works seamlessly when customers access the store with or without `www.` or any other custom prefix.

### Adding `subDomainPrefix` for prefixed domains

To ensure customers can view products in the secured environment on your store final domain, add the `subDomainPrefix` property to the [`dicovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-4-understanding-the-project-structure#files) file. 
The `subDomainPrefix` property maintains compatibility between cookies set in the storefront and the secure environment.

To add the `subDomainPrefix` property, follow these steps:

1. Open your FastStore project in a code editor of your preference.
2. Open the `discovery.config.js` file.
3. Navigate to the `api` object and add the following:

   ```js
   // Platform specific configs for API
   api: {
    ...
    subDomainPrefix: ['xxx']
   },
   ```

   > ⚠ Replace `'xxx'` in the `subDomainPrefix` property with the actual subdomain prefix (example: `['b2b']`). If you have multiple prefixes, add them as an array of strings (example: `['b2b', 'dev']`).

4. Save your changes.
5. Open a Pull Request, commit your changes, and deploy them to `main`.
