title: "Adding an image to the Alert component"
---

This guide illustrates an advanced use case for [`getOverriddenSection`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-getoverriddensection-function) in FastStore. It focuses on customizing the [Alert](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections#alert) section's icon to display a custom image as an icon instead.

> ℹ️ For detailed instructions on overriding components, refer to [Overriding native component’s props](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-component-props) and [Overriding a native component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-native-component).

## Context

- The native [Alert](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections#alert) section provides an `icon` prop for customization. It only accepts predefined icons, but you want more control and flexibility over the displayed content.
- You want to display a custom image as the icon alongside the text in your alert messages.

## Implementation

By leveraging `getOverriddenSection`, you can create a custom component called `AlertWithImage` that achieves the desired functionality. Follow the steps below:

1. In the `src/components/sections` folder, create the folder `AlertWithImage` folder.
2. In the `AlertWithImage` folder, create the `AlertWithImage.tsx` file.
3. Import the following to the `AlertWithImage.tsx` file:

   ```tsx
   import { getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";
   import Image from "next/image";
   import { useMemo } from "react";
   ```

4. Define the `AlertWithImageProps` interface:

   ```tsx focus=5:9
   import { getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";
   import Image from "next/image";
   import { useMemo } from "react";

   interface AlertWithImageProps
     extends Omit<React.ComponentProps<typeof AlertSection>, "icon"> {
     src: string;
     alt: string;
   }
   ```

   - This interface defines the props accepted by the `AlertWithImage` component.
   - It inherits all props from the native Alert component, excluding the icon prop, which we intend to replace with an image.
   - It adds a new prop named `src`, which specifies the image source URL.

5. Create the `AlertWithImage` component:

   ```tsx focus=10:31
   import { useMemo } from "react";
   import { AlertSection, getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";
   import { Image_unstable as Image } from "@faststore/core/experimental";

   interface AlertWithImageProps
     extends Omit<React.ComponentProps<typeof AlertSection>, "icon"> {
     src: string;
     alt: string;
   }

   export default function AlertWithImage(props: AlertWithImageProps) {
     const { src, alt, ...otherProps } = props;

     const OverriddenAlert = useMemo(
       () =>
         getOverriddenSection({
           Section: AlertSection,
           className: styles.alertWithImage,
           components: {
             Icon: {
               Component: () => (
                 <Image
                   src={props.src}
                   alt={props.alt}
                   width={24}
                   height={24}
                 />
               ),
             },
           },
         }),
       []
     );

     return <OverriddenAlert {...otherProps} icon="" />;
   }
   ```

   - This function receives the `AlertWithImageProps`.
   - It destructures the `src` prop containing the image source and remaining props using the spread operator (`...otherProps`).
   - The core functionality lies within the `useMemo` hook.

     - It defines the `OverriddenAlert` constant using `getOverriddenSection`.
     - The override options specify:
       - **`Section`:** The section to be overridden (Alert).
       - **`components`:** An object containing the override for the Icon component.

   - Inside the Icon override:

     - **`Component`:** A function returning an `Image` component. This displays the image specified by the `src` prop.
     - **`width`** and **`height`:** Optional props to set the size of the image.

   - The use of `useMemo` ensures this override is only created once, improving performance.
   - The function returns the `OverriddenAlert` component, spreading the `otherProps` and setting the `icon` prop to `noop` (effectively disabling the default icon behavior).

6. Add the section to the Headless CMS by following the instructions available in [syncing components to the Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-syncing-components-with-the-headless-cms).

   The following schema was used as an example in [`cms/faststore/sections.json`](https://github.com/vtex-sites/playground.store/blob/main/cms/faststore/sections.json#L58-L101):

    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "AlertWithImage",
        "schema": {
          "title": "Alert with image",
          "description": "Add an Alert that has an Image as an icon",
          "type": "object",
          "required": [
            "src",
            "content",
            "dismissible"
          ],
          "properties": {
            "src": {
              "type": "string",
              "title": "Image source",
              "description": "Source of the Alert icon image"
            },
            "content": {
              "type": "string",
              "title": "Content"
            },
            "link": {
              "title": "Link",
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "text": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "title": "Link Text"
                },
                "to": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "title": "Action link"
                }
              }
            },
            "dismissible": {
              "type": "boolean",
              "default": false,
              "title": "Is dismissible?"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

## Results

Once you have [set your development mode](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-previewing-changes-in-development-mode) to see the changes locally, you can see the image as an icon in the alert:

- **Before**

  The native Alert displays one of the default icons, the `BellRinging`, following the sentence `Get 15% off today: NEW15! Buy now`.

- **After**

  The native Alert was replaced with the custom one, which features a pink image in the form of an icon added through Headless CMS.
