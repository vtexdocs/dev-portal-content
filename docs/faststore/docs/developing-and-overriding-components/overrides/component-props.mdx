title: Overriding native component's props
---

Overriding props allows you to customize a component's behavior while preserving its native integration. This approach is useful when you want to customize specific aspects of a native component, for example, an icon or a button label. 

For this guide, we'll use the [Buy Button](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-buy-button) component to make the customization. 

Here's how the initial component looks with the `size` prop set as `regular` in the Product Details Page (PDP):

## Before you begin

Make sure your `@faststore/core` package has the 3.x version or above. If you need to update
it, refer to this [release note](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Setting up the component file

1. After choosing a native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections), open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Create a new branch to work with the custom component you will create.
3. Go to the `src` folder, create the `components` folder, and inside it, create the `sections` folder. You can run the following command to create them:

    > ℹ️ The naming of the `sections` folder is arbitrary, as overrides can be created in any file since the import is made in the `src/components/index.tsx` file. 

    <Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
        <Tab>```bash copy mkdir src/components src/components/sections ```</Tab>
        <Tab>```bash copy mkdir src\components src\components\sections ```</Tab>
    </Tabs>

4. In the `sections` folder, create a new file for your customized section. For example, create a new file named `ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx` under the `src/components/sections` directory.

    <Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
        <Tab>
            ```bash copy touch src/components/sections/ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab>
            ```bash copy type nul > src\components\sections\ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx
            ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

5. Copy and paste the following code snippet into the file:

    ```tsx ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx
    import { ProductDetailsSection, getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'

    const ProductDetailsWithCustomButton = getOverriddenSection({
    Section: ProductDetailsSection,
    components: {},
    })

    export default ProductDetailsWithCustomButton;
    ```

    > ℹ️ Change the value of the `Section` variable to the section you wish to override. In the given example, we set the `Section` variable to the component `ProductDetailsSection` to override this specific section.

6. Save your changes.

### Step 2 - Setting up the override

1. Open the `ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx` file created in the [Step 1 - Setting up the component file](#step-1-setting-up-the-overrides-folder) and add the following code:

    ```tsx ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx mark=5,6,7
    import { ProductDetailsSection, getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'
    
    const ProductDetailsWithCustomButton = getOverriddenSection({
    Section: ProductDetailsSection,
    components: {
        BuyButton: { props: { size: "small", iconPosition: "right" } } 
    },
    });
    
    export default ProductDetailsWithCustomButton;
    ```

2. In the `components` folder, create the `index.tsx` file and add the following. This code overrides the `BuyButton` props `size` and `iconPosition`.

    ```tsx index.tsx
    import ProductDetailsWithCustomButton from "./sections/ProductDetailsWithCustomButton";

    const sections = {

    ProductDetails: ProductDetailsWithCustomButton
    };
    export default sections;

    ```

3. Open the terminal, and run `yarn dev` to sync the new custom component to your store preview. 
4. Open the localhost available after running `yarn dev`. You'll see a smaller button than the initial one, and the cart icon positioned on the right side.

### Step 3 - Publishing your changes

If your changes are working locally and you want to publish them in production, follow the steps below:

1. Publish your branch with the custom components files.
2. Open a pull request in the store's GitHub repository.
3. Review the pull request
4. Merge the changes from this branch to the `main` one and the new component will be available in the live store.
