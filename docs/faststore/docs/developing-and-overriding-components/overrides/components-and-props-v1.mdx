title: 'Overriding native components and props (v1)'
---

> ⚠️ This guide is for stores using Section overrides v1. For instructions on how to use Section overrides v2, refer to the [Section overrides v2](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-overview)

In this guide, you will learn how to modify a component's behavior using additional properties in your store code and create new components by overriding their native equivalents.

These features are useful when you need a customized behavior for a specific component not available in the [FastStore native options](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections).

> ⚠️ We highly recommend considering [overriding props](#override-native-components-props) or utilizing the [theming tools](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/using-themes-components) provided by `@faststore/core` to achieve the desired behavior. Overriding a component inside a section will compromise the existing integration developed in [`@faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#faststorecore) by losing updates for that component.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Ensure you have a functioning FastStore project

Make sure you have a functioning FastStore project after following the [FastStore onboarding](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-overview) and [setting up the project](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-2-setting-up-the-project).

### Check the version compatibility of your `faststore/core` package

This feature is available for stores using `@faststore/core` 2.1.36 version and above.

### Choose a native section and the component you want to customize

The [`@faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#faststorecore) package provides a set of native sections, each consisting of different components with unique functionalities.
Refer to the [List of native sections and overridable components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections#faststore-native-sections) to explore available native sections.

### Consider two aspects of this feature

Keep in mind the following aspects when using this feature:

- **This feature is experimental**: The feature may not function as expected.

- **Some sections contain multiple instances of the same component**: When overriding a component or passing additional props to it, consider that all instances will be affected by this change.

</Steps>

## Override native component's props

Overriding props allows you to customize a component's behavior while preserving its native integration. This approach is useful when you want to modify specific aspects of a native component.

All component customizations in FastStore are performed within a section, and to override props, you need to choose the desired native section and component from the [List of available native sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections#faststore-native-sections).

For this guide, we'll use the [`BuyButton`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-buy-button#props) component to make the customization.

Here's how the initial component looks like with the `size` prop set as `regular` in the PDP (Product Details Page):

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-initial](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-pdp-buy-button-initial___a4b7ae9d88ed888da5649b2b6cc1eecd.png)

### Instructions

#### Step 1 - Setting up the `overrides` folder

1. After choosing a native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections), open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Go to the `src` folder, create the `components` folder and inside it, create the `overrides` folder.  You can run the following command to create them:

<Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
<Tab>
```bash
mkdir src/components src/components/overrides
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
mkdir src\components src\components\overrides
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

3. Inside the `overrides` folder, create a new file named after the chosen native section. For example, if you chose the `ProductDetails` section for customization, create a new file named `ProductDetails.tsx` under the `src/components/overrides` directory.

<Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
<Tab>
```bash
touch src/components/overrides/ProductDetails.tsx
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
type nul > src\components\overrides\ProductDetails.tsx
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

4. Copy and paste the following code snippet into the file:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {}
}

export { override }
```

> Change the value of the `SECTION` variable to the name of the section you want to override. In the given example, we set the `SECTION` variable to `ProductDetails` to override this specific section.

5. Save your changes.

#### Step 2 - Setting up the override

1. Open the `ProductDetails.tsx` file created in the [Setting up the `overrides` folder step](#step-1-setting-up-the-overrides-folder) and add the following code:

```tsx filename="ProductDetails.tsx" {8-9}
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    BuyButton: { props: { size: 'small', iconPosition: 'right' } },
  },
}

export { override }
```

This code overrides the `BuyButton` props `size` and `iconPosition`. You'll see a smaller button than the initial one and the cart icon positioned on the right side.

2. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser and go to the product details page to see the updated `BuyButton` component:

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-props](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-pdp-buy-button-props___898b016bd82c908b5b24c8822be6789a.png)

> ⚠️ Remember: props changed via Headless CMS overlap the changes made through [override](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-overriding-components-and-props#override-native-components-props). For example, if you change a prop through override and also change it using Headless CMS, the final prop's value will be the one added using CMS.

## Overriding a native component

Now that you know how to [override a component's prop](#override-native-components-props), learn how to override a native component to use a custom component.

For example, you may want to replace the current `BuyButton` component from the `ProductDetails` section to meet your business needs.

Currently, when the `BuyButton` is clicked, it opens the `CartSideBar` as its default behavior:

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-component](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-buy-button-open-cart___a5853a88238fa31610a93e8a1333bb00.gif)

For this guide, we will create a custom Buy Button that, once you click on it, displays an `alert` for the customer and the custom Product Title.


### `BuyButton`

#### Step 1 - Create your custom component

1. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `CustomBuyButton.tsx`. _If you haven't created the `components` folder yet, see the [Setting up the overrides folder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-overriding-components-and-props#step-1---setting-up-the-overrides-folder) step._

<Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
<Tab>
```bash
touch src/components/CustomBuyButton.tsx
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash
type nul > src\components\CustomBuyButton.tsx
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

> ℹ️ When creating a custom component, it's important to choose a name that distinguishes it from the native component. For example, `Custom{ComponentName}` = `CustomBuyButton`.

2. Add the following code into `CustomBuyButton.tsx` file:

```tsx CustomBuyButton.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button as UIButton } from '@faststore/ui'

export function CustomBuyButton() {
  return (
    <UIButton
      variant="primary"
      onClick={() => {
        alert('Hello User!')
      }}
    >
      New Buy Button
    </UIButton>
  )
}
```

The provided code imports the [Button](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-button) component from the [@faststore/ui](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/) package. The code defines the `CustomBuyButton` component that displays an alert message when clicked based on the behavior we want.
However, you have the flexibility to customize the component to achieve a different behavior if needed.

#### Step 2 - Overriding the component

1. Choose a component to override from the [list of overridable components of each native section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections). In this example, we are overriding the `BuyButton` component in the `ProductDetails` section.
2. Navigate to `src/components/overrides` that we've created [before](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-overriding-components-and-props#step-1---setting-up-the-overrides-folder).
3. Open the `ProductDetails.tsx` file and update it with the following code:

```tsx ProductDetails.tsx mark=8:9
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core'
import { CustomBuyButton } from '../CustomBuyButton'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    BuyButton: { Component: CustomBuyButton },
  },
}

export { override }
```

4. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser. Navigate to the product details page, you should see the CustomBuyButton component in place of the previous BuyButton component.

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-component-alert](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-buy-button-open-alert___b62f8cb5f3f98f6bd0f5502081de6a9b.gif)

By using your custom component, you may need to customize it from scratch. See [Customizing a New Component when using Override](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/using-themes-components#customizing-a-new-component-when-using-override) guide for more details about styling it.

### `Product Title`

1. After [Setting up the overrides folder](#step-1-setting-up-the-overrides-folder), inside the  `components` folder, create the `CustomProductTitle.tsx` file.
2. Add the following to the file:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { ProductTitle, Tag } from '@faststore/ui'


export default function CustomProductTitle() {
  return (
    <section>
      <ProductTitle title={<h1>New headphones</h1>} />
      <Tag variant="warning" label="On sale" onClose={() => {}} />
    </section>
  )
}
```

This code creates a custom `ProductTitle` component displaying the product title and a tag indicating that the product is on sale.

3. In the `overrides` folder, create the `ProductDetails.tsx` file.
2. Add the following code to the `ProductDetails.tsx` file to render the new `CustomProductTitle` component.

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core'

import CustomProductTitle from '../CustomProductTitle'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    ProductTitle: { Component: CustomProductTitle },
  },
}

export { override }
```

4. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server and access the provided localhost URL in your browser.

## Overriding components while maintaining default configuration

In specific scenarios, when you want to keep the default integration or component configuration partially, you can use prior integrations within your custom component.

> ⚠️ Note that this will only work if your custom component's props are compatible with the overriding component. We encourage using [FastStore UI components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/) to leverage existing features, basic styles, and better props compatibility.

Building upon our previous example, we could pass the `BuyButton` props to our new component.
This approach allows us to incorporate the icon and cart sidebar integration while introducing additional functionality to the `onClick` function, such as triggering an alert or sending an event to analytics.

```tsx CustomBuyButton.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button as UIButton, ButtonProps } from '@faststore/ui'

export function CustomBuyButton(props: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <UIButton
      {...props}
      variant="primary"
      onClick={(event) => {
        alert('You will love this product!')
        props.onClick?.(event)
      }}
    >
      New Buy Button
    </UIButton>
  )
}
```

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-extra](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-buy-button-extra___324292e9c8c20cf10f515876a9b33ed1.gif)

In this example, when clicked, the `CustomBuyButton` component will display an alert message and then open the `CartSideBar`, keeping its default behavior.

This feature can open up numerous possibilities for exploration and customization in your store. Happy exploring! 🎉
