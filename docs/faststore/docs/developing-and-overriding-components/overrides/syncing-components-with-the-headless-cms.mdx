After incorporating overridden components, sections, and [updating the props](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-component-props) of FastStore native components, one crucial step
is to ensure their availability in the Headless CMS.

## Instructions

1. In the FastStore root directory, create a folder named `cms`.
2. Inside `cms`, create the `faststore` folder.
3. Within the `cms/faststore` folder, create the `sections.json` file.
4. Add the schema of the new section to the `sections.json` file. The schema defines how the Headless CMS renders the section.
 
    > ℹ️ Refer to the Step 3: Adding sections to the Headless CMS guide for further information on how to structure the schema. Also, refer to the [List of Native Sections and Overridable Components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections) to check the schemas for each component.

5. Open the terminal and log in to your vtex account by running `vtex login {accountName}`.

6. run the following command to sync your changes with the Headless CMS:

    ```bash
    faststore cms-sync
    ```
7. Access the VTEX Admin and proceed to **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
8. Click on the page you desire to add the new section.
9. Click the add button (`+`) and add the new section.
