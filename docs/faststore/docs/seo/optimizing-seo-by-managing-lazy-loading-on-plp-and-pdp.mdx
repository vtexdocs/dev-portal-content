title: "Optimizing SEO by managing lazy loading on PLPs and PDPs"
---

By default, FastStore improves performance by wrapping store sections in `LazyLoadingSection` and `ViewportObserver` components. These components delay the loading of non-essential sections until they are needed, for example, when a user scrolls near them. This approach reduces initial page load times and enhances the user experience, especially on slower networks or devices.

While lazy loading enhances performance, it may negatively impact SEO. Search engine crawlers often do not execute JavaScript or wait for dynamically loaded content. Consequently, important sections like product grids on category pages might not be indexed. For example, if a user accesses the `gym clothes` collection, its product listings might not be returned in search results if that content is not included in the initial HTML.

In this guide, learn how to optimize SEO by managing lazy loading for custom sections in FastStore.

> ❗ Disabling lazy loading may increase initial page load time. Use this only when necessary.

## Deciding when to lazy load

Lazy loading can improve store performance and SEO, but it must be used strategically. To help you decide when to implement lazy loading, the tables below outline the contexts, the benefits, and the risks involved.

<details>
<summary>When to implement lazy loading ✅</summary>

| Context | Benefit | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **To load content that isn't immediately visible** | Improves initial page-load speed by delaying non-critical assets that are below the fold. | A homepage with promotional banners and lookbooks that load as the user scrolls down the page. |
| **To improve page-speed for a media-heavy page** | Optimizes resource usage and ensures the most important content is prioritized and loads first. | A PDP includes a "Complete the Look" carousel at the bottom. Since these are supplementary suggestions, lazy loading ensures the main product details are prioritized, and the carousel images load only when the user scrolls to that section. |
| **The content doesn't affect SEO or crawling** | It won't negatively impact search engine visibility since the content isn't critical for SEO or structured data. | A store's homepage has a "Fashion Trends" slider in the footer with inspirational videos. Since this content does not impact structured product data for SEO, lazy loading it will not negatively affect search engine visibility. |
| **To balance server-load during high traffic** | It reduces server spikes by only loading images visible on the screen, keeping the browsing experience fast. | Category pages like "Dresses" or "Jeans" may have hundreds of product image previews. With lazy loading, only the images visible above the fold load immediately, reducing server spikes and keeping the browsing experience fast. |

<summary>When to avoid lazy loading ❌</summary>

| Context | Reason to avoid | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The store section is part of your core PLP or PDP** | Essential product details like names, prices, and descriptions must be immediately visible to users and search engines. | A "Jeans" category page where product names and thumbnails need to load instantly for indexing and shoppers do not experience delays in viewing products. |
| **All product content needs to appear for search engines** | Critical content for SEO, like size charts and availability, must be crawlable and indexable immediately. | On a product page for a best-selling jacket, size charts and availability information should load instantly. Lazy loading these elements would hide vital product data from search engines, potentially harming SEO and user conversions. |
| **There is a risk of hiding critical page elements from crawlers** | Search engines might not see all content if it's lazy-loaded, potentially harming your site's SEO. | A "New Arrivals" grid on your homepage displays featured items from several categories. Lazy loading is skipped here to ensure search engines can index every new product shown in this grid. |
| **To avoid overloading all store content simultaneously** | Lazy loading should be applied selectively. Overloading a page with too many assets can exhaust crawl budgets and slow indexing. | A homepage with numerous campaign images that should be lazy-loaded to avoid slowing down the site and increasing server-load. |

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update the `@faststore/cli` package

Make sure the `@faststore/cli` package is updated to the latest version. To update it, follow the instructions in [Updating the `@faststore/cli` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-cli-package-version).

### Configure SEO for PLPs and PDPs

Set up title and description templates in the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file to dynamically generate metadata for PLPs and PDPs, such as collections, categories, subcategories, or brands.
For instructions, see the [Configuring SEO for PLPs and PDPs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/seo-configuring-seo-for-plp-and-pdp) guide.

</Steps>

## Instructions

### Step 1: Controlling lazy loading for custom sections

FastStore lazy-loads sections to improve store performance. However, some [custom sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-creating-a-new-section), such as those containing H1 headers, may need to appear in the initial HTML for SEO purposes. To disable lazy loading for these sections, consider the following:

1. Open the `cms/faststore/sections.json` file in your project.
2. Locate your custom section in the file, add the `skipLazyLoadingSection` property, and set it to `true`. For example, if your custom section is named `CustomSEOSection`, the configuration would look like this:

   ```json
   ...
   {
     "name": "CustomSEOSection",
     "schema": {
       "title": "SEO Section",
       "description": "Custom H1 configuration",
       "type": "object",
       "required": ["skipLazyLoadingSection"],
       "properties": {
         "skipLazyLoadingSection": {
           "title": "Skip lazy loading",
           "type": "boolean",
           "default": true
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. To display PLP data (e.g., collection names) in a custom section, use the [`usePLP()`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-consuming-api-extensions#consuming-api-extensions-data-from-custom-sections) hook. For PDP data (e.g., product titles), use the [`usePDP()`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-consuming-api-extensions#hooks-for-consuming-api-extension-data) hook.

<details>
<summary>`usePLP()` hook</summary>

   ```tsx
   import { usePLP } from "@faststore/core";

   export default function CustomPLPName() {
     const context = usePLP();

     return (
       <section>
         <h1>Testing - {context.data?.collection?.seo?.title ?? "PLP"}!</h1>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>`usePDP()` hook</summary>

   ```tsx
   import { usePDP } from "@faststore/core";

   export default function CustomPDPName() {
     const context = usePDP();

     return (
       <section>
         <h1>Testing - {context.data?.product?.seo?.title ?? "PDP"}!</h1>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```

</details>

### Step 2: Sending the changes to the Headless CMS

1. Open the terminal and run `yarn cms-sync` to synchronize your local changes with the Headless CMS.
2. Go to the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
3. Access the **Product List Page** or **Product Details Page** Content Type. For this example, we will use the **Product List Page** Content Type.

   > ⚠ Repeat these steps for the **Product Details Page** Content Type if optimizing a PDP section.

4. Add the custom section you created. The **Skip lazy loading** option will appear at the end of the section.

   ![skip-lazy-loading-ui-option](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/skip-lazy-loading___2a0ca0c7a90d61cda31c2ce9200e377f.png)

5. Click `Save` and publish the changes you made.
6. Click `Preview`.
7. Search for a collection name to see the new section. For example, if you have a collection named "Just Arrived," you can view it by adding its slug to your store's URL (e.g., `https://mystore.vtex.app/just-arrived`). You will see something similar to the following:

   ![custom-section-ui](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/custom-section___48bf7d70d678b4fb4ddae39aa0cf14cb.png)

    <details>
      <summary>**PDP example**</summary>
      
      For PDPs, test with a product URL (e.g., `https://mystore.vtex.app/p/blue-shirt`). The image below shows the **New Arrivals** title on the PDP.

    </details>

### Step 3: Checking if the custom section is visible to search engines

To ensure that the custom section is present in the initial HTML response, follow these steps:

1. In the browser, right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** from the context menu.
2. In the **Developer Tools** panel, click the **Network** tab. Ensure that the **All filter** is selected.

   > ℹ To focus only on the main HTML document, you can filter by **Doc** in the filter bar. This will show only the initial HTML request, making it easier to inspect the page's source code.

3. Reload the page while the Developer Tools are open. This will capture all network requests made during the page load.
4. In the **Name** column of the **Network** tab, look for the request corresponding to the page you are inspecting. In our example, this would be `just-arrived`.
5. Click the **Response** tab in this panel.
6. If the section is in the initial HTML response, you will see the corresponding HTML code in the **Response** tab. For example:

   ![developer-tools-panel](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/developer-tools-panel___9240a6f4b36ce8151f6d346e78674f2b.png)

If the section is in the initial HTML, as in the example above, it means it is not lazy-loaded and is visible to search engines.
