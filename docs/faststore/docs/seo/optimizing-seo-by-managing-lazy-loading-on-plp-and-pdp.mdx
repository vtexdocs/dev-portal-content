title: "Optimizing SEO by managing lazy loading on PLPs and PDPs"
---

FastStore uses lazy loading to improve performance by deferring non-critical sections until they are needed. This reduces initial page load time and improves the browsing experience, especially on slower devices and networks.

This guide explains how to manage lazy loading for custom sections to balance SEO and performance on Product List Pages (PLPs) and Product Details Pages (PDPs).

> ❗ Disabling lazy loading may increase initial page load time. Use it only for critical, above-the-fold content. To help you decide, see [Deciding when to lazy load](#deciding-when-to-lazy-load).

## How lazy loading works in FastStore

Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of non-critical resources, like images or entire page sections, until they're needed. In the context of e-commerce, this usually means content below the initial viewport. FastStore uses `LazyLoadingSection` and `ViewportObserver` to implement this. This strategy significantly reduces the initial page load time, especially on slower devices and networks.

However, be cautious: disabling lazy loading for too many elements can increase initial page load time. It should only be used for critical, **above-the-fold content**. 

### SEO and performance trade-Off

Search engines, like Google, use crawlers to discover and index web content. While modern crawlers can execute JavaScript to render a page, this process can be delayed or incomplete. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that **critical commerce content** is included in the initial HTML to guarantee it's indexed.

Lazy loading can improve **Core Web Vitals (CWV)**, which are important SEO ranking factors. By deferring heavy resources, lazy loading helps improve:

* **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** By prioritizing the hero image and other above-the-fold content, you can ensure the main content loads quickly.
* **Interaction to Next Paint (INP):** Deferring heavy JavaScript reduces main-thread contention, making the page more responsive.
* **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Reserving space for lazy-loaded components prevents unexpected layout shifts as new content loads.

On the other hand, rendering all content upfront can speed up discovery for crawlers but can also consume **crawl budget**, slow down indexing for other pages on your site, and hurt user-perceived performance due to increased initial payload size.

## When to use lazy loading

Use lazy loading strategically to avoid hiding important content from crawlers. If critical content is not present in the initial HTML, search engines may fail to index important sections like product grids on a PLP.

Use this checklist to decide when to lazy load:

* **Critical for indexing?** Is the content essential for search engines to understand the page (e.g., PLP product grid, PDP title/price)?
    * **Yes:** **Do not** lazy load.
    * **No:** **Safe** to lazy load.
* **Above the fold?** Is it visible on the initial screen for most devices?
    * **Yes:** **Do not** lazy load.
    * **No:** **Safe** to lazy load.
* **Structured data dependency?** Does it contain data for Schema.org or other in-HTML SEO signals?
    * **Yes:** **Do not** lazy load.
    * **No:** **Safe** to lazy load.
* **Ancillary content?** Is it supportive content like carousels, lookbooks, or footers?
    * **Yes:** **Safe** to lazy load.
    * **No:** **Do not** lazy load.
* **Media-heavy?** Does the section contain many heavy images or videos below the fold?
    * **Yes:** **Safe** to lazy load.
    * **No:** **Do not** lazy load.

### **Quick Guide for PLPs and PDPs**

To simplify your decision-making, here's a quick guide:

**Product List Pages (PLPs)**

* **Do not lazy load:** Main category heading, product grid (names, prices, primary images), and primary filters.
* **Safe to lazy load:** Auxiliary content blocks, secondary carousels, and user-generated content (UGC) widgets.

**Product Details Pages (PDPs)**

* **Do not lazy load:** Product title, price, first image/variant selector, and key product specifications.
* **Safe to lazy load:** "Complete the Look" carousels, long review sections, and additional media galleries beyond the first image.

<summary>When to implement lazy loading ✅</summary>

| Context | Benefit | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **To load content that isn't immediately visible** | Improves initial page load speed by delaying non-critical assets that are below the fold. | A homepage with promotional banners and lookbooks that load as the user scrolls down the page. |
| **To improve page speed for a media-heavy page** | Optimizes resource usage and ensures the most important content is prioritized and loads first. | A PDP includes a "Complete the Look" carousel at the bottom. Since this is a supplementary suggestion, lazy loading ensures the main product details are prioritized, and the carousel images load only when the user scrolls to that section. |
| **The content doesn't affect SEO or crawling** | It won't negatively impact search engine visibility since the content isn't critical for SEO or structured data. | A store's homepage has a "Fashion Trends" slider in the footer with inspirational videos. Since this content does not impact structured product data for SEO, lazy loading it will not negatively affect search engine visibility. |
| **To balance server load during high traffic** | It reduces server spikes by loading only images visible on the screen, keeping the browsing experience fast. | Category pages like "Dresses" or "Jeans" may have hundreds of product image previews. With lazy loading, only the images visible above the fold load immediately, reducing server spikes and keeping the browsing experience fast. |

<summary>When to avoid lazy loading ❌</summary>

| Context | Reason to avoid | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The store section is part of your core PLP or PDP** | Essential product details like names, prices, and descriptions must be immediately visible to users and search engines. | A "Jeans" category page where product names and thumbnails need to load instantly for indexing and shoppers do not experience delays in viewing products. |
| **All product content needs to appear for search engines** | Critical content for SEO, like size charts and availability, must be crawlable and indexable immediately. | On a product page for a best-selling jacket, size charts and availability information should load instantly. Lazy loading these elements would hide vital product data from search engines, potentially harming SEO and user conversions. |
| **There is a risk of hiding critical page elements from crawlers** | Search engines might not see all content if it's lazy-loaded, potentially harming your site's SEO. | A "New Arrivals" grid on your homepage displays featured items from several categories. Lazy loading is skipped here to ensure search engines can index every new product shown in this grid. |
| **Do not disable lazy loading globally** | Apply lazy loading selectively. Rendering everything up front increases payloads, exhausts crawl budget, and slows indexing. | A homepage with numerous campaign images should lazy load secondary media while keeping critical content immediately available. |

By following these guidelines, you can ensure your e-commerce pages are fast for users and fully discoverable for search engines.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update the `@faststore/cli` package

Make sure the `@faststore/cli` package is updated to the latest version. To update it, follow the instructions in [Updating the `@faststore/cli` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-cli-package-version).

### Configure SEO for PLPs and PDPs

Set up title and description templates in the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file to dynamically generate metadata for PLPs and PDPs, such as collections, categories, subcategories, or brands.
For instructions, see the [Configuring SEO for PLPs and PDPs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/seo-configuring-seo-for-plp-and-pdp) guide.

</Steps>

## Instructions

### Step 1: Controlling lazy loading for custom sections

FastStore lazy loads sections to improve store performance. However, some [custom sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-creating-a-new-section), such as those containing H1 headers, may need to appear in the initial HTML for SEO purposes. To disable lazy loading for these sections, consider the following:

1. Open the `cms/faststore/sections.json` file in your project.
2. Locate your custom section in the file, add the `skipLazyLoadingSection` property, and set it to `true`. For example, if your custom section is named `CustomSEOSection`, the configuration would look like this:

   ```json
   ...
   {
     "name": "CustomSEOSection",
     "schema": {
       "title": "SEO Section",
       "description": "Custom H1 configuration",
       "type": "object",
       "required": ["skipLazyLoadingSection"],
       "properties": {
         "skipLazyLoadingSection": {
           "title": "Skip lazy loading",
           "type": "boolean",
           "default": true
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. To display PLP data (e.g., collection names) in a custom section, use the [`usePLP()`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-consuming-api-extensions#consuming-api-extensions-data-from-custom-sections) hook. For PDP data (e.g., product titles), use the [`usePDP()`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-consuming-api-extensions#hooks-for-consuming-api-extension-data) hook.

<details>
<summary>`usePLP()` hook</summary>

   ```tsx
   import { usePLP } from "@faststore/core";

   export default function CustomPLPName() {
     const context = usePLP();

     return (
       <section>
         <h1>Testing - {context.data?.collection?.seo?.title ?? "PLP"}!</h1>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>`usePDP()` hook</summary>

   ```tsx
   import { usePDP } from "@faststore/core";

   export default function CustomPDPName() {
     const context = usePDP();

     return (
       <section>
         <h1>Testing - {context.data?.product?.seo?.title ?? "PDP"}!</h1>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```

</details>

### Step 2: Sending the changes to the Headless CMS

1. Open the terminal and run `yarn cms-sync` to synchronize your local changes with the Headless CMS.
2. Go to the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
3. Access the **Product List Page** or **Product Details Page** Content Type. For this example, we will use the **Product List Page** Content Type.

   > ⚠ Repeat these steps for the **Product Details Page** Content Type if optimizing a PDP section.

4. Add the custom section you created. The **Skip lazy loading** option will appear at the end of the section.

   ![skip-lazy-loading-ui-option](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/skip-lazy-loading___2a0ca0c7a90d61cda31c2ce9200e377f.png)

5. Click `Save` and publish the changes you made.
6. Click `Preview`.
7. Search for a collection name to see the new section. For example, if you have a collection named "Just Arrived," you can view it by adding its slug to your store's URL (e.g., `https://mystore.vtex.app/just-arrived`). You will see something similar to the following:

   ![custom-section-ui](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/custom-section___48bf7d70d678b4fb4ddae39aa0cf14cb.png)

    <details>
      <summary>**PDP example**</summary>
      
      For PDPs, test with a product URL (e.g., `https://mystore.vtex.app/p/blue-shirt`). The image below shows the **New Arrivals** title on the PDP.

    </details>

### Step 3: Checking if the custom section is visible to search engines

To ensure that the custom section is present in the initial HTML response, follow these steps:

1. In the browser, right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** from the context menu.
2. In the **Developer Tools** panel, click the **Network** tab. Ensure that the **All filter** is selected.

   > ℹ To focus only on the main HTML document, you can filter by **Doc** in the filter bar. This will show only the initial HTML request, making it easier to inspect the page's source code.

3. Reload the page while the Developer Tools are open. This will capture all network requests made during the page load.
4. In the **Name** column of the **Network** tab, look for the request corresponding to the page you are inspecting. In our example, this would be `just-arrived`.
5. Click the **Response** tab in this panel.
6. If the section is in the initial HTML response, you will see the corresponding HTML code in the **Response** tab. For example:

   ![developer-tools-panel](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/developer-tools-panel___9240a6f4b36ce8151f6d346e78674f2b.png)

If the section is in the initial HTML, as in the example above, it means it is not lazy-loaded and is visible to search engines.

## Best practices after lazy loading

After adjusting lazy loading, monitor impact and iterate. Focus on measurable outcomes and protect both crawlability and Core Web Vitals.

### PLP/PDP verification checklist

- PLP server HTML: Ensure the category title and first set of product tiles (name, price, primary image) are present in the initial HTML response.
- PDP server HTML: Ensure the product title, price, first image, and variant selector render in the initial HTML.
- Images: First visible image should not be lazy‑loaded. Use `fetchpriority="high"` on the LCP image when appropriate; add `decoding="async"` and proper `srcset`/`sizes` for responsive images.
- Placeholders: Reserve space (via `width`/`height` or `aspect-ratio`) for deferred content to prevent CLS.
- Controls: Filters/sort that are SEO‑relevant should be usable without JS for crawlability (progressive enhancement where feasible).

### Monitoring Core Web Vitals

- Track LCP, INP, and CLS using PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, and Search Console’s Core Web Vitals report.
- Identify the LCP element and confirm it is server‑rendered and not lazy‑loaded; preconnect/preload critical origins/assets when needed.
- Defer or idle‑callback non‑critical scripts; move heavy third‑party tags out of the initial viewport to protect INP.
- Use skeletons or low‑quality image placeholders (LQIP/blur) for deferred media; ensure reserved space to avoid shifts.

### Google Search Console analysis

- Use URL Inspection > Test Live URL to review the rendered HTML and screenshot of Googlebot’s view.
- Verify critical PLP/PDP content is present in the initial HTML and also visible post‑render.
- Avoid custom attributes for source URLs (e.g., `data-src`). Prefer standard `src` and apply `loading="lazy"` only to below‑the‑fold images.
- Monitor Indexing/Coverage and CWV reports for templates you changed; compare before/after.

### Rollout and verification

- Roll out gradually and compare KPIs (CWV, bounce rate, time to first interaction, indexation) before full deployment.
- For infinite scroll, expose crawlable pagination or a discoverable “Load more” URL pattern to deeper content.
- In DevTools Network, verify the initial document Response includes the critical PLP/PDP HTML expected by crawlers.

### Common pitfalls

- Intersection thresholds too strict: If `rootMargin` or thresholds are misconfigured, content may never intersect during crawler rendering.
- Hidden sources: Libraries that keep image URLs only in `data-*` attributes can hide media from crawlers.
- Global opt‑out: Disabling lazy loading everywhere bloats initial payloads, harms CWV, and consumes crawl budget.
