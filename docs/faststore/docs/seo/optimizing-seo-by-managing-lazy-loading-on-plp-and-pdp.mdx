title: "Optimizing SEO by managing lazy loading on PLPs and PDPs"
---

By default, FastStore improves performance by wrapping store sections in `LazyLoadingSection` and `ViewportObserver` components. These components delay the loading of non-essential sections until it's needed, such as when a user scrolls near it. This approach reduces initial page load times and enhances the user experience, especially on slower networks or devices.

While lazy loading enhances performance, it may negatively impact SEO. Search engine crawlers often don't execute JavaScript or wait for dynamically loaded content. Consequently, important sections like product grids on category pages might not be indexed. For example, if a user accesses the `gym clothes` collection, its product listing might not be returned in search results if not included in the initial HTML.

In this guide, learn how to optimize SEO by managing lazy loading for custom sections in FastStore.

> ❗ Disabling lazy loading may increase initial page load time. Use it only when necessary.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update the `@faststore/cli` package

Make sure the `@faststore/cli` package is updated to the latest version. If you need to update it, follow the instructions on [Updating the '@fastore/cli' package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-cli-package-version).

### Configure SEO for PLPs and PDPs

Set up title and description templates in the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file to dynamically generate metadata for PLPs and PDPs, such as collections, categories, subcategories, or brands.
For instructions, see the [Configuring SEO for PLPs and PDPs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/seo-configuring-seo-for-plp-and-pdp) guide.

</Steps>

## Instructions

### Step 1: Controlling lazy loading for custom sections

FastStore lazy-loads sections to improve store performance. However, some [custom sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-creating-a-new-section), such as those containing H1 headers, may need to appear in the initial HTML for SEO purposes. To disable lazy loading for these sections, consider the following:

1. Open the `cms/faststore/sections.json` file in your project.
2. Locate your custom section in the file, add the `skipLazyLoadingSection` property, and set it to `true`. For example, if your custom section is named `CustomSEOSection`, the configuration would look like this:

   ```json
   ...
   {
     "name": "CustomSEOSection",
     "schema": {
       "title": "SEO Section",
       "description": "Custom H1 configuration",
       "type": "object",
       "required": ["skipLazyLoadingSection"],
       "properties": {
         "skipLazyLoadingSection": {
           "title": "Skip lazy loading",
           "type": "boolean",
           "default": true
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. To display PLP data (for example, collection names) in a custom section, use the [`usePLP()`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-consuming-api-extensions#consuming-api-extensions-data-from-custom-sections) hook. For PDP data (e.g., product titles), use [`usePDP()`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-consuming-api-extensions#hooks-for-consuming-api-extension-data) hook:

    <details>
    <summary>`usePLP()` hook</summary>

      ```tsx
      import { usePLP } from '@faststore/core'

        export default function CustomPLPName() {
          const context = usePLP()

          return (
            <section>
              <h1>Testing - {context.data?.collection?.seo?.title ?? 'PLP'}!</h1>
            </section>
          )
        }
      ```

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>`usePDP()` hook</summary>

      ```tsx
      import { usePDP } from '@faststore/core'

        export default function CustomPDPName() {
          const context = usePDP()

          return (
            <section>
              <h1>Testing - {context.data?.product?.seo?.title ?? 'PDP'}!</h1>
            </section>
          )
        }
      ```

    </details>

### Step 2: Sending the changes to the Headless CMS

1. Open the terminal and run `yarn cms-sync` to synchronize your local changes with the Headless CMS.
2. Go to the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
3. Access the **Product List Page** or **Product Details Page** Content Type. For this instruction, we'll use the **Product List Page** Content Type.

    > ⚠ Repeat these steps for the **Product Details Page** Content Type if optimizing a PDP section.

4. Add the custom section you created. At the end of the section, you’ll notice the **Skip lazy loading** option.

   ![skip-lazy-loading-ui-option](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/skip-lazy-loading___2a0ca0c7a90d61cda31c2ce9200e377f.png)

5. Click `Save` and publish the changes you made.
6. Click `Preview`.
7. Search for a collection name to see the new section. For example, if you have a `Just arrived` collection, add its slug to the URL, for example: `https://mystore.vtex.app/just-arrived`. You’ll be able to see something similar to the following:

   ![custom-section-ui](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/custom-section___48bf7d70d678b4fb4ddae39aa0cf14cb.png)

    <details>
      <summary>**PDP example**</summary>
      
      For PDPs, test with a product URL (e.g., `https://mystore.vtex.app/p/blue-shirt`). In the exampe below, we have the **New arrivals** title for the PDP.

      ![pdp-title-section](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/pdp___01ad8375320cc80e565347e057927e97.png)
    
    </details>

### Step 3: Checking if the custom section is visible to search engines

To make sure that the custom section is present in the initial HTML response, follow these steps:

1. In the browser, right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** from the context menu.
2. In the **Developer Tools** panel, click the **Network** tab. Ensure that the **All filter** is selected.

   > ℹ To focus only on the main HTML document, you can filter by **Doc** in the filter bar. This will show only the initial HTML request, making it easier to inspect the page's source code.

3. Reload the page while the Developer Tools are open. This will capture all network requests made during the page load.
4. In the **Name** column of the **Network** tab, look for the request corresponding to the page you're inspecting In our example `just-arrived`.
5. Click the **Response** tab in this panel.
6. If the section is in the initial HTML response, you will see the corresponding HTML code in the **Response** tab. For example:

   ![developer-tools-panel](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/developer-tools-panel___9240a6f4b36ce8151f6d346e78674f2b.png)

If the section is in the initial HTML, as in the example above, it means it is not lazy-loaded and is visible to search engines.
