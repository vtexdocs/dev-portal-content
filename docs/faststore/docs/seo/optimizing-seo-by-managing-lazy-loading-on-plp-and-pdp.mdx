title: "Optimizing SEO by managing lazy loading on PLPs and PDPs"
---

By default, FastStore improves performance by wrapping store sections in `LazyLoadingSection` and `ViewportObserver` components. These components delay the loading of non-essential sections until they are needed, for example, when a user scrolls near it. This approach reduces initial page load times and enhances the user experience, especially on slower networks or devices.

While lazy loading enhances performance, it may negatively impact SEO. Search engine crawlers often don't execute JavaScript or wait for dynamically loaded content. Consequently, important sections like product grids on category pages might not be indexed. For example, if a user accesses the `gym clothes` collection, its product listing might not be returned in search results if not included in the initial HTML.

In this guide, learn how to optimize SEO by managing lazy loading for custom sections in FastStore.

> ❗ Disabling lazy loading may increase initial page load time. Use this only when necessary.


## Deciding when to lazy load

Lazy loading can improve store performance and SEO, but it must be used strategically. Below is a checklist to help you decide when to use lazy loading to balance fast page speeds with search engine crawlability.

### When to use lazy loading? ✅

<CheckboxField label="The content is not immediately visible" id="checkboxfield-account" />

<details>
<summary>Lazy loading is ideal for content that appears below the fold—the part of a webpage that users must scroll down to see.</summary>

By delaying the loading of these non-critical assets, the initial page load speed is significantly faster, allowing users to interact with the core content without delay.

Example: A clothing store's homepage has "Seasonal Offers" promotional banners and lookbooks further down the page. Lazy loading these large images ensures shoppers see top-selling categories immediately, while the heavier promotional assets only load as they scroll.

</details>

<CheckboxField label="The page speed needs to be improved" id="checkboxfield-account" />

<details>
<summary>Use lazy loading for deferred content that isn't essential for the initial view.</summary>

This optimizes resource usage and improves overall page speed.

Example: A PDP includes a "Complete the Look" carousel at the bottom. Since these are supplementary suggestions, lazy loading ensures the main product details are prioritized, and the carousel images only load when the user scrolls to that section.

Lazy loading is a great way to improve the initial page load speed for visitors, especially on media-heavy pages.

Example: A product page has a "Customer Gallery" with user-uploaded photos below the main product pictures. Lazy loading these gallery images speeds up the initial PDP load, so customers see the core product information and main photos instantly.

</details>

<CheckboxField label="The content doesn't affect SEO or crawling" id="checkboxfield-account" />

<details>
<summary>Lazy loading is suitable for content that does not contain structured product data or other critical SEO information.</summary>

Example: A store's homepage has a "Fashion Trends" slider in the footer with inspirational videos. Since this content doesn't impact structured product data for SEO, lazy loading it won't negatively affect search engine visibility.
</details>

<CheckboxField label="Balanced server load" id="checkboxfield-account" />

<details>
<summary>Lazy loading helps manage server load on pages with many images or heavy resources, especially during high-traffic periods.</summary>

Example: Category pages like "Dresses" or "Jeans" may have hundreds of product image previews. With lazy loading, only the images visible above the fold load immediately, reducing server spikes and keeping the browsing experience fast.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update the `@faststore/cli` package

Make sure the `@faststore/cli` package is updated to the latest version. To update it, follow the instructions in [Updating the `@faststore/cli` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-cli-package-version).

### Configure SEO for PLPs and PDPs

Set up title and description templates in the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file to dynamically generate metadata for PLPs and PDPs, such as collections, categories, subcategories, or brands.
For instructions, see the [Configuring SEO for PLPs and PDPs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/seo-configuring-seo-for-plp-and-pdp) guide.

</Steps>

## Instructions

### Step 1: Controlling lazy loading for custom sections

FastStore lazy-loads sections to improve store performance. However, some [custom sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-creating-a-new-section), such as those containing H1 headers, may need to appear in the initial HTML for SEO purposes. To disable lazy loading for these sections, consider the following:

1. Open the `cms/faststore/sections.json` file in your project.
2. Locate your custom section in the file, add the `skipLazyLoadingSection` property, and set it to `true`. For example, if your custom section is named `CustomSEOSection`, the configuration would look like this:

   ```json
   ...
   {
     "name": "CustomSEOSection",
     "schema": {
       "title": "SEO Section",
       "description": "Custom H1 configuration",
       "type": "object",
       "required": ["skipLazyLoadingSection"],
       "properties": {
         "skipLazyLoadingSection": {
           "title": "Skip lazy loading",
           "type": "boolean",
           "default": true
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. To display PLP data (e.g., collection names) in a custom section, use the [`usePLP()`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-consuming-api-extensions#consuming-api-extensions-data-from-custom-sections) hook. For PDP data (e.g., product titles), use the [`usePDP()`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-consuming-api-extensions#hooks-for-consuming-api-extension-data) hook.

    <details>
    <summary>`usePLP()` hook</summary>

      ```tsx
      import { usePLP } from '@faststore/core'

        export default function CustomPLPName() {
          const context = usePLP()

          return (
            <section>
              <h1>Testing - {context.data?.collection?.seo?.title ?? 'PLP'}!</h1>
            </section>
          )
        }
      ```

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>`usePDP()` hook</summary>

      ```tsx
      import { usePDP } from '@faststore/core'

        export default function CustomPDPName() {
          const context = usePDP()

          return (
            <section>
              <h1>Testing - {context.data?.product?.seo?.title ?? 'PDP'}!</h1>
            </section>
          )
        }
      ```

    </details>

### Step 2: Sending the changes to the Headless CMS

1. Open the terminal and run `yarn cms-sync` to synchronize your local changes with the Headless CMS.
2. Go to the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
3. Access the **Product List Page** or **Product Details Page** Content Type. For this example, we'll use the **Product List Page** Content Type.

    > ⚠ Repeat these steps for the **Product Details Page** Content Type if optimizing a PDP section.

4. Add the custom section you created. At the end of the section, you will notice the **Skip lazy loading** option.

   ![skip-lazy-loading-ui-option](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/skip-lazy-loading___2a0ca0c7a90d61cda31c2ce9200e377f.png)

5. Click `Save` and publish the changes you made.
6. Click `Preview`.
7. Search for a collection name to see the new section. For example, if you have a collection named "Just Arrived," you can view it by adding its slug to your store's URL (e.g., `https://mystore.vtex.app/just-arrived`). You will see something similar to the following:

   ![custom-section-ui](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/custom-section___48bf7d70d678b4fb4ddae39aa0cf14cb.png)

    <details>
      <summary>**PDP example**</summary>
      
      For PDPs, test with a product URL (e.g., `https://mystore.vtex.app/p/blue-shirt`). In the example below, you will see the **New arrivals** title on the PDP.

      ![pdp-title-section](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/pdp___01ad8375320cc80e565347e057927e97.png)
    
    </details>

### Step 3: Checking if the custom section is visible to search engines

To ensure that the custom section is present in the initial HTML response, follow these steps:

1. In the browser, right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** from the context menu.
2. In the **Developer Tools** panel, click the **Network** tab. Ensure that the **All filter** is selected.

   > ℹ To focus only on the main HTML document, you can filter by **Doc** in the filter bar. This will show only the initial HTML request, making it easier to inspect the page's source code.

3. Reload the page while the Developer Tools are open. This will capture all network requests made during the page load.
4. In the **Name** column of the **Network** tab, look for the request corresponding to the page you are inspecting. In our example, this would be `just-arrived`.
5. Click the **Response** tab in this panel.
6. If the section is in the initial HTML response, you will see the corresponding HTML code in the **Response** tab. For example:

   ![developer-tools-panel](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/developer-tools-panel___9240a6f4b36ce8151f6d346e78674f2b.png)

If the section is in the initial HTML, as in the example above, it means it is not lazy-loaded and is visible to search engines.
