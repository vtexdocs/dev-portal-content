title: "Configuring product price meta tag formatting on PDP"
---

FastStore lets you control how the `product:price:amount` meta tag is formatted on Product Detail Pages (PDPs). Use the `minPriceAmountFractionDigits` setting in `discovery.config.js` to define the minimum number of decimal places displayed in this meta tag. This is useful to ensure consistency between:

- The Open Graph meta tag (`product:price:amount`).
- The structured data included in the PDP HTML (`ProductJsonLd` schema).
- External integrations such as [Google Merchant Center](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9773429).

## Step 1: Review recommendations

Before applying this setting, make sure you actually need to enforce a fixed number of decimal places in your SEO metadata. This configuration directly affects how the `product:price:amount` meta tag is rendered, and its value must be consistent with the product price used in the schema on the PDP (`<script type="application/ld+json">`).
If the number of decimal places differs between the meta tag and the structured data, platforms such as Google Merchant Center may flag a price mismatch issue. To avoid this, choose a value that aligns with your store's currency format and pricing strategy.

For example:

- ✅ Schema price: `3.20` → Meta tag: `3.20`
- ❌ Schema price: `3.20` → Meta tag: `3.2`

## Step 2: Update `discovery.config.js`

1. Open your FastStore project and locate the `discovery.config.js` file.
2. In the `seo` section, add `minPriceAmountFractionDigits` with the number of decimal places you want to enforce.

    ```js
    seo: {
    // ...
    pdp: {
      titleTemplate: '%s | FastStore PDP',
      descriptionTemplate: '%s products on FastStore Product Detail Page',
      minPriceAmountFractionDigits: 2,
    },
    },
    ```

3. Deploy the change above.

## Step 3: Validate the result

1. Open a PDP in your store.
2. Open your browser's DevTools (or use View Page Source).
3. Confirm that the `<meta property="product:price:amount">` value uses the configured number of decimal places. For example:

    ```html
    <meta property="product:price:amount" content="3.20" />
    ```

4. In the same page, search for `application/ld+json` and check the product `offers.price` value in the PDP schema.
5. Confirm that `product:price:amount` and schema `offers.price` use the same formatting and precision (for example, `3.20`, not `3.2`).

> ⚠️ Validate more than one PDP after deployment to confirm consistent formatting between the meta tag and schema values.
