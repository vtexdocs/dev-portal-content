---

The `discovery.config.js` is a configuration file for managing various settings that control store behavior, appearance, and functionality. It works as a central hub for configuring key aspects of a FastStore website, such as SEO, API connections, session management, URLs, analytics, and more.

## Example file

```javascript
module.exports = {
  seo: {
    title: "FastStore Starter",
    description: "Fast Demo Store",
    titleTemplate: "%s | FastStore",
    author: "FastStore",
  },
  theme: "custom-theme",
  platform: "vtex",
  api: {
    storeId: "storeframework",
    workspace: "master",
    environment: "vtexcommercestable",
    hideUnavailableItems: false,
    incrementAddress: false,
  },
};
```
