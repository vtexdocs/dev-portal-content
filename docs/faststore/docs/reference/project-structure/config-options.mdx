> ⚠️ This documentation is currently under development.

The `discovery.config.js` file is the central configuration file for managing store settings.
It allows you, for example, to set SEO settings, define the store ID, select a theme, and set up custom Cypress tests. Check out the example for this file: [`discovery.config.js` sample code](https://github.com/vtex-sites/starter.store/blob/main/discovery.config.js).

> ⚠️ `discovery.config.js` is the new filename for the legacy one `faststore.config.js`. If you still using the legacy name, please refer to [this release note](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes/2024-12-16-discovery-config-file) to update it.
