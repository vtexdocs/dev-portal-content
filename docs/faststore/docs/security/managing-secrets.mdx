title: "Managing Secrets"
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to manage secrets in your FastStore project using [WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview).

Secrets are sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and tokens, that must be securely managed during the FastStore project deployment.

[WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview) centralizes and standardizes secrets management, ensuring a consistent and secure process across all deployment providers. This ensures that sensitive information is kept out of your project’s codebase and is retrieved securely by WebOps.

>ℹ️ In FastStore v1, secrets management required an empty `vtex.env` file at the project's root. Secrets were defined in `secrets.revealed.json` and then encrypted into `secrets.hidden.json` before being committed to the main branch. In FastStore v2+, this workflow has been deprecated, and secrets are now managed directly through the WebOps interface.

## Local development

For local development, you must use the `vtex.env` file to define secrets needed to run your FastStore project locally. 

The `vtex.env` file is only used in local environments and should always be added to `.gitignore` to avoid leaking secrets through version control. By adding it to `.gitignore`, secrets defined in the `vtex.env` file will not be available in deployed environments via WebOps.

## Instructions

To manage your secrets, access your [FastStore WebOps dashboard](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard) and navigate to the **Settings** tab.

In the [Secrets](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#secrets) section, you can [create](#creating-secrets), [update](#updating-secrets), or [delete](#deleting-secrets) secrets following the steps below.

### Creating secrets

1. In the `Key` field, enter the name of the secret, which serves as its unique identifier (example: VTEX_API_TOKEN, NEXT_SECRET_KEY). In the `Value` field, enter the corresponding sensitive information you want to store (example: the actual token, key, or password).

   >ℹ Secrets accessible in the browser (client-side) must start with the prefix `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. For all other secrets, use other names without this prefix.

2. Click `Add`. A pop-up with `New Secret added successfully` will open. Then, you'll see the message `Secrets have changed. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.` alongside a `Redeploy` button.

   >⚠ When creating multiple secrets, make sure you include all of them before proceeding to the next step. This prevents synchronization errors.

3. Click `Redeploy` to redeploy your website with the updated secret configuration. You’ll see the message `Redeploying with secret changes`, then a pop-up with `Deployment created successfully` will open.
4. Follow the deployment status in the [Deploys](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#deploys) tab of the WebOps dashboard.

   During the build process, any secrets registered through WebOps will be transformed into environment variables within the code, automatically loading them into the `process.env` object. You can access these values in your code using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`. For further details, refer to the Next.js guide [How to use environment variables in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/environment-variables).

   The secret created will be available in the **Current Keys** section.

### Updating secrets

1. Go to the `Current Keys` section.
2. Alongside the secret you need to update, click `⋮`, then click `Edit`.
3. Click `Update`.  A pop-up with `Secret updated successfully` will open. Then, you'll see the message `Secrets have changed. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.` alongside a `Redeploy` button.
4. Click `Redeploy` to redeploy your website with the updated secret configuration. You’ll see the message `Redeploying with secret changes`, then a pop-up with `Deployment created successfully` will open.
5. Follow the deployment status in the [Deploys](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#deploys) tab of the WebOps dashboard.

### Deleting secrets

1. Go to the `Current Keys` section.
2. Alongside the secret you need to update, click `⋮`, then click `Delete`.
3. Validate the secret you want to remove. 

   >⚠ This action can’t be undone.

4. Click `Delete secret`. A pop-up with `Secret deleted successfully` will open. Then, you'll see the message `Secrets have changed. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.` alongside a `Redeploy` button.
5. Click `Redeploy` to redeploy your website with the updated secret configuration. You’ll see the message `Redeploying with secret changes`, then a pop-up with `Deployment created successfully` will open.
6. Follow the deployment status in the [Deploys](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#deploys) tab of the WebOps dashboard.

>ℹ If you tried to create, update, or delete a secret and received the error `Failed to create/update/delete secret. Please, try again.`, repeat the process. If the problem persists, open a ticket to [VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).
