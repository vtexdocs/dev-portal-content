title: "Managing Secrets"
---

Secrets are sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and tokens, that must be securely managed during the FastStore project deployment process. [WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview) centralizes and standardizes secrets management, ensuring a consistent and secure process across all deployment providers.

This functionality leverages [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/secrets-manager/) as a centralized repository for managing and retrieving secrets across all WebOps projects. As a result, secrets can be securely stored and accessed without embedding them directly within the project.

In this guide, you'll learn how to manage secrets in your FastStore project using [WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview).

## Secrets flow

The Secrets feature employs a structured method for interacting with deployment providers based on project-specific configurations. Below is an example of a successful flow that illustrates how WebOps determines the appropriate provider based on the project’s settings and then delegates the build and deployment process accordingly.

  actor User as User
  participant WebOps as WebOps
  participant AWS as AWS Secrets Manager
  participant ProviderA as Provider A
  participant ProviderB as Provider B
  participant ProviderN as Provider N

  %% 1. User initiates secret creation/update/deletion
  User ->> WebOps: Request to create/update/delete secret

  %% 2. WebOps stores secret in AWS Secrets Manager
  WebOps ->> AWS: Store/Update/Delete secret
  AWS -->> WebOps: Confirm secret storage/update/deletion

  %% 3. WebOps determines which provider to use for build/deployment
  WebOps ->> WebOps: Select configured provider

  %% 4. WebOps propagates secret to selected provider and initiates build
  alt Provider A
    WebOps ->> ProviderA: Transmit secret securely
    ProviderA ->> ProviderA: Consume secret, prepare environment
    WebOps ->> ProviderA: Start build/deployment
    ProviderA ->> ProviderA: Build and host application
    ProviderA -->> WebOps: Send status update
  else Provider B
    WebOps ->> ProviderB: Transmit secret securely
    ProviderB ->> ProviderB: Consume secret, prepare environment
    WebOps ->> ProviderB: Start build/deployment
    ProviderB ->> ProviderB: Build and host application
    ProviderB -->> WebOps: Send status update
  else Provider N
    WebOps ->> ProviderN: Transmit secret securely
    ProviderN ->> ProviderN: Consume secret, prepare environment
    WebOps ->> ProviderN: Start build/deployment
    ProviderN ->> ProviderN: Build and host application
    ProviderN -->> WebOps: Send status update
  end

  %% 5. Feedback to user
  WebOps -->> User: Notify build and secret operation success
```

1. User initiates request
The user initiates a request to create, update, or delete a secret through the WebOps interface.

2. Secret storage
a. WebOps forwards the request made by the user (create, update, or delete a secret) to AWS Secrets Manager.
b. AWS confirms the request ("and store the secret"?).

4. Provider selection
a. With the AWS confirmation of the request, WebOps identifies the appropriate deployment provider based on the project’s configuration.
b. WebOps securely transmits the secret information to the selected provider.

5. Secret deployment
a. The chosen provider consumes the secret and prepares the environment.
b. WebOps triggers the build and the secret deployment process.
c. The provider builds and hosts the application and returns a status update to WebOps.

6. WebOps notification to the user
a. Provider sends status update to WebOps.
b. In the WebOps interface, the user receives confirmation of the successful secret operation and its deployment.

## Instructions

To manage your secrets, access your [FastStore WebOps dashboard](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard) and navigate to the **Settings** tab.

In the [Secrets](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#secrets) section, you can [create](#creating-secrets), [update](#updating-secrets), or [delete](#deleting-secrets) secrets following the steps below.

### Creating secrets

1. Input the related values in the `Key` and `Value` fields.
2. Click `Add`. You’ll see the message: `New Secret added successfully. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.`
3. Click on `Redeploy`. You’ll see the message: `Creating deployment…`, then `Deployment created successfully`.

### Updating secrets

1. Go to the `Current Keys` section.
2. Alongside the secret you need to update, click `⋮`, then click `Edit`.
3. Update the secret in the modal that will open.
4. Click `Update`. You’ll see the message: `Secret updated successfully. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.`
5. Click on `Redeploy`. You’ll see the message: `Creating deployment…`, then `Deployment created successfully`.

### Deleting secrets

1. Go to the `Current Keys` section.
2. Alongside the secret you need to update, click `⋮`, then click `Delete`.
3. Validate the secret you want to remove. 

   >⚠ This action can’t be undone.

4. Click `Delete secret`. You’ll see the message: `Secret deleted successfully. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.`
5. Click on `Redeploy`. You’ll see the message: `Creating deployment…`, then `Deployment created successfully`.

>ℹ Follow the deployment status in the [Deploys](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#deploys) tab of the WebOps dashboard.
