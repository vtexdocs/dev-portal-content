title: "Implementing refresh token"
---

[Refresh token](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/refresh-token-flow-for-headless-implementations) is a security method that allows users to obtain a new, short-lived access token without requiring them to log in again.

In this guide, learn how to implement the refresh token workflow in a FastStore store.

> ℹ️ For more information on how the refresh token flow works, refer to the Refresh token flow for headless implementation guide.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update your FastStore project

Make sure your project is updated to the latest version. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in a code editor.
2. Open a terminal and run the following command to update the FastStore packages to the latest version:

```bash
yarn upgrade -L --scope @faststore
```

### Request the refresh token activation

Open a ticket with [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) to request the refresh token activation and expiration time, such as 7 days. Include the account name(s) to enable the feature in your request. Without the activation, you won’t be able to enable the refresh token in your account.

</Steps>

## Instructions

1. Open your FastStore project in a code editor.
2. Go to `discovery.config.js` file,  in the `experimental` section, add the `refreshToken` flag with the value `true`:


    ```js discovery.config.js
    experimental: {
        …
        refreshToken: true
    }
    ```

3. Commit and push your changes to the main branch to deploy the update to production.
