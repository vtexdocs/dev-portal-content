title: "Implementing refresh token on FastStore"
---

[Refresh token](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/refresh-token-flow-for-headless-implementations) is a security mechanism that allows users to obtain a new, short-lived access token without requiring them to log in again.

The [FastStore SDK Session](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/sdk-overview#session) abstracts the [refresh token](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/refresh-token-flow-for-headless-implementations) flow logic and handles the entire refresh token flow, including token renewal, session management, and error handling.

In this guide, learn how to implement the refresh token flow in a FastStore store.

> ℹ️ For background on how refresh tokens work, refer to the [Refresh token flow for headless implementation guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/refresh-token-flow-for-headless-implementations).

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update your FastStore project

Make sure your project is updated to the latest version. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in a code editor.
2. Open a terminal and run the following command to update the FastStore packages to the latest version:

```bash
yarn upgrade -L --scope @faststore
```

### Request refresh token activation

Open a ticket with [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) to request refresh token activation and an expiration time (1, 7, or 30 days). Include the account name(s) in your request to enable the feature. Without this activation, you won’t be able to enable the refresh token in your account.

</Steps>

## Instructions

1. Open your FastStore project in a code editor.
2. In the `discovery.config.js` file, within the `experimental` section, add the `refreshToken` flag and set its value to `true`:


    ```js discovery.config.js
    experimental: {
        …
        refreshToken: true
    }
    ```

3. Commit and push your changes to the main branch to deploy the update to production.
