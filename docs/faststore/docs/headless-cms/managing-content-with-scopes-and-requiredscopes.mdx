> ⚠️ This feature is only available for [FastStore v1](https://v1.faststore.dev/docs)

`scopes` and `requiredScopes` are Headless CMS schema definitions that determine which store sections can be added to specific pages (defined within [Content Types](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-3-adding-content-types-and-sections#step-2-adding-content-types-to-the-headless-cms)).

These features help manage the content structure and ensure store sections are used in appropriate contexts. For example, the [Hero](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-hero) component is only available for the homepage or pages like the Product Details Page (PDP).

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update the `@faststore/core` package version

Make sure you have `@faststore/core` version `3.0.18` or greater to benefit from this feature. If you don't have the updated package, follow the instructions in [Updating the `@faststore/core` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-core-package-version).

### Set Headless CMS

Make sure to have set the Headless CMS files `content-types.json` and `sections.json` in your store project by following the [Setting up the Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-2-setting-up-the-headless-cms) guide. These files contain the store’s custom Content Types and sections.

</Steps>

## `scopes`

`scopes` are labels that define the context provided by a Content Type. They help categorize Content Types based on their capabilities.

The `scopes` are string arrays within the definition of your Content Type in the [`content-types.json` file](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-3-adding-content-types-and-sections#step-2-adding-content-types-to-the-headless-cms). For example:

```json
{
  "id": "home",
  "name": "Home",
  "scopes": ["home"],
  "isSingleton": true,
  "configurationSchemaSets": [...]
}
```

In this example, the `Home` Content Type stores content for your home page and has a `scopes` named `home`. This `scopes` definition means that only sections designed for the home page context can be used with this Content Type.

### Default FastStore `scopes`

When [creating custom sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-3-adding-content-types-and-sections), you can restrict their usage to specific Content Types using these default scopes:

| `scopes` name | Content Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|`custom`|Landing Page|
|`global`|Global Sections|
|`landing`|Landing Page|
|`pdp`|Product Details Page|
|`plp`|Product Listing Page|
|`search`|Search Page|

## `requiredScopes`

`requiredScopes` defines the Content Types a section can be used in. Similar to `scopes`, they are specified as string arrays within the section definition in the [`sections.json` file](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-3-adding-content-types-and-sections#step-3-adding-sections-to-the-headless-cms).

A section is only available for a Content Type in Headless CMS if the Content Type `scopes` include at least one matching `scopes` from the section's `requiredScopes`. Sections without any `requiredScopes` can be used in any Content Type.

In the following example, the [`ProductShelf` section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-product-shelf) is only available for PDPs:

```json
{
  "name": "ProductShelf",
  "requiredScopes": ["pdp"],
  "schema": {...},
}
```

### Empty `requiredScopes`

When a section has an empty `requiredScopes` (`[]`), the section is available for all Content Types. In the following example, the [`Navbar` section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-navbar) is available to use in any Content Type because it has no required `scopes`:

```json
{
  "name": "Navbar",
  "requiredScopes": [ ],
  "schema": {...}
}
```

### Default FastStore `requiredScopes`

When [creating custom sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-3-adding-content-types-and-sections#step-3-adding-sections-to-the-headless-cms) for Headless CMS, you can use these default `requiredScopes` for specific Content Types:

| `requiredScopes` name | Section name |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
|`custom`|`CrossSelingShelf`|
|`pdp`|`CrossSelingShelf`, `Breadcrumb`, and `ProductDetails`|
|`plp`|`Breadcrumb` and `ProductGallery`|
|`search`|`ProductGallery`|

## Using `scopes` and `requiredScopes`

In the following example, let’s set a new Content Type `Custom Page` to display a new `Call To Action` section.

![create-custom-page](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/scoped-sections-final-result___0b7a9ad190b98753b7a99edec657f3f5.png)

> ⚠️ To better understand this tutorial, make sure you create the new `Call To Action` component by following the instructions in the [Creating a new section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-creating-a-new-section#call-to-action) guide.

### Setting up the Headless CMS files

> ⚠️ Make sure to have set up the Headless CMS files `content-types.json` and `sections.json` in your store project by following the [Setting up the Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-2-setting-up-the-headless-cms) guide. These files contain the store custom Content Types and sections.

1. In the `content-types.json` file, create a new `Custom Page` Content Type by adding the following:

    ```json content-types.json
    {
        "id": "customPage",
        "name": "Custom Page",
        "scopes": ["custom"],
        "configurationSchemaSets": [
            {
                "name": "Settings",
                "configurations": [
                    {
                        "name": "seo",
                        "schema": {
                            "title": "SEO",
                            "description": "Search Engine Optimization options",
                            "type": "object",
                            "widget": {
                                "ui:ObjectFieldTemplate": "GoogleSeoPreview"
                            },
                            "required": ["slug", "title", "description"],
                            "properties": {
                                "slug": {
                                    "title": "Path",
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "default": "/"
                                },
                                "title": {
                                    "title": "Default page title",
                                    "description": "Display this title when no other title is available",
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "default": "FastStore Starter"
                                },
                                "description": {
                                    "title": "Meta tag description",
                                    "type": "string",
                                    "default": "A beautifully designed store"
                                },
                                "canonical": {
                                    "title": "Canonical url for the page",
                                    "type": "string"
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    We defined the `"scopes": ["custom"]` for the new `customPage` Content Type. The `custom` scope is also the [`landingPage` default scope defined in FastStore](#default-faststore-scopes).

2. In the `sections.json` file, add the following:

    ```json sections.json
    [
        {
            "name": "CallToAction",
            "requiredScopes": ["custom"],
            "schema": {
                "title": "Call To Action",
                "description": "Get your 20% off on the first purchase!",
                "type": "object",
                "required": [
					"title",
					"link"
				],
                "properties": {
                    "title": {
                        "title": "Title",
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "link": {
                        "title": "Link Path",
                        "type": "object",
                        "required": [
							"text",
							"url"
						],
                        "properties": {
                            "text": {
                                "title": "Text",
                                "type": "string"
                            },
                            "url": {
                                "title": "URL",
                                "type": "string"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

We defined that the `Call To Action` section will only be available for `customPage` and `landingPage` Content Types.

> ℹ️ Remember that the `Call To Action` section is also available for the `landingPage` Content Type because the [`custom` scope is default for it in FastStore](#default-faststore-scopes).

When editing the `Custom Page` Content Type, the Headless CMS checks its scopes (`custom`) and matches them against the sections' `requiredScopes` (`custom`). Since the Call to Action section matches the Custom Page and Landing Page scope, the section is available to use in these two Content Types.

### Syncing the Headless CMS changes

1. Open the terminal and run `yarn cms-sync` to sync the new files created in the previous step.
2. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > Headless CMS**, and open the FastStore project.
3. Click on the `Create Document` dropdown.
4. Click on `Custom Page`:

5. In the `Sections` tab, click on `Add Section` (`+`).
6. Select the **Call To Action** section.
7. Set the section fields as you wish.
8. Click `Save`.
9. Click `Preview` to preview the saved content. You will see a section similar to the image below with a title **Shop deals in Fashion** and a Call To Action button `See all deals`.
