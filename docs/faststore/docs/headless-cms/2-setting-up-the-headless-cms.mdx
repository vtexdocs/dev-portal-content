Now that you are familiar with the core concepts of the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview) and have set it up in your VTEX account let's get back to our **FastStore** project to define our own **Content Types** and **Sections**.

By the end of this part of this tutorial, you will be able to see your first definition of a content type available for use in the Headless CMS app. Next, we will dive deeper into how to create these definitions in a smoother way.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Integrate the store with the Headless CMS

To add and manage sections on your store's pages, all sections must be available in the Headless CMS. To integrate your FastStore project, please refer to the [Headless CMS integration track](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-1-configuring-the-vtex-account).

### Install the FastStore CLI

Make sure to install the FastStore CLI to use its commands locally. Refer to the [FastStore CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-cli) guide for more information.

### Creating CMS-related files

This guide assumes that you are starting without any existing CMS-related files.
If your project already includes any of the following files: `content-types.json` or `sections.json`, follow the instructions in [Step 1 - Creating the CMS folder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-2-setting-up-the-headless-cms#step-1-creating-the-cms-folder) to create only the necessary files for your project's requirements.

</Steps>

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Creating the CMS folder

1. Open the terminal and change to the root directory of your FastStore project.
2. Create a new folder named `cms` at the root of your FastStore project and a subfolder named `faststore` inside the `cms`. Run the following command to create them:

<Tabs items={["macOs and Linux", "Windows"]} defaultIndex="0">
  <Tabs>
    ```bash 
    mkdir -p cms/faststore 
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash 
    mkdir cms\faststore 
    ```
  </Tabs>
</Tabs>

3. Create the two files below inside the `faststore` folder by running the following command:

> ⚠️ If your project already includes the CMS-related files: `content-types.json` or `sections.json`, create only the necessary files for your project's requirements.

<Tabs items={["macOs and Linux", "Windows"]} defaultIndex="0">
  <Tab>
    ```bash 
    touch cms/faststore/content-types.json cms/faststore/sections.json
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```bash 
    type nul > cms\faststore\content-types.json 
    type nul > cms\faststore\sections.json 
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

| File name            | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content-types.json` | An array of JSON objects that describes the **Content Types** available for customization at the Headless CMS app.                                        |
| `sections.json`      | An array of JSON objects that describes the content structure of the frontend **Section** components available for customization at the Headless CMS app. |

5. Update the `sections.json` file with an empty array:

  ```bash
  echo "[]" > cms/faststore/sections.json
  ```

6. Open the `content-types.json` file in any code editor of your choice and add the following code:

  ```json cms/faststore/content-types.json
  [
    {
      "id": "customPage",
      "name": "Custom Page",
      "configurationSchemaSets": [
        {
          "name": "Settings",
          "configurations": [
            {
              "name": "seo",
              "schema": {
                "title": "SEO",
                "description": "Search Engine Optimization options",
                "type": "object",
                "widget": {
                  "ui:ObjectFieldTemplate": "GoogleSeoPreview"
                },
                "required": ["slug", "title", "description"],
                "properties": {
                  "slug": {
                    "title": "Path",
                    "type": "string",
                    "default": "/"
                  },
                  "title": {
                    "title": "Default page title",
                    "description": "Display this title when no other title is available",
                    "type": "string",
                    "default": "FastStore Starter"
                  },
                  "description": {
                    "title": "Meta tag description",
                    "type": "string",
                    "default": "A beautifully designed store"
                  },
                  "canonical": {
                    "title": "Canonical url for the page",
                    "type": "string"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

> ℹ️ Don't worry about the structure of this file for now, as we'll learn more about it later in this tutorial.
> However, notice that we have defined the **Custom Page** Content Type.

7. Save your changes in the `content-types.json` file.

8. Open the terminal and run `yarn dev` to enable the watch mode for the FastStore CLI.
   This command will monitor any changes in the project, including the new section you have created, and automatically merge it with the default sections available in [`faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson).

### Step 2 - Syncing your changes

Let's now sync the changes with the Headless CMS app and see what happens.

1. Open another terminal and log in to your VTEX account.

2. Create a new development workspace by running the following command. _Remember to replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario_:

  ```bash
  vtex use {workspace}
  ```

> ⚠️ Use a development workspace to try your definitions of Sections and Content Types before syncing them with the VTEX `master` workspace.

3. Change to the root directory of your FastStore project.

4. Sync your changes in the `cms` folder with the Headless CMS app:

  ```bash
  faststore cms-sync
  ```

> ⚠️ If you have the `@vtex/cli-plugin-cms@1.0.7` installed you can use the `{builderName}` argument to synchronize a specific builder: `vtex cms:sync {builderName}`.

Once your changes are synced with the Headless CMS, the terminal will show the following message:

  ```bash
  CMS synced successfully...
  ```

### Step 3 - Checking your changes

1. Access the VTEX Admin using the workspace you created in [Step 2 -Syncing your changes](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-2-setting-up-the-headless-cms#step-2-syncing-your-changes) by navigating to the following path: `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com/admin`. Make sure to replace `{workspace}` with the designated workspace name and `{account}` with your VTEX account.
2. Go to **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
3. Click on **Create New**.

You should now see the content type we created in the previous step available for use in the Headless CMS app.
However, no Sections will be available yet. We'll learn more about this in the following part of this track, [Structuring Content Types and Sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-3-adding-content-types-and-sections).
