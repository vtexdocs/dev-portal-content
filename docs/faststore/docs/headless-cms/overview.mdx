In this guide, you will be presented with **Headless CMS**, the solution for content management in FastStore projects. By using the Headless CMS, you can empower editors to create, edit, and publish web content independently through the VTEX Admin.

As a developer, you are responsible not only for creating custom frontend solutions for your client's store but also for defining which content of the storefront will be editable via a Content Management System (CMS). A CMS allows others to edit the frontend content of your store without having to touch your code at all.

## Before you begin

Before you proceed, please ensure the following:

<Steps>

### Access to a VTEX account

Ensure you have a VTEX account to set up the Headless CMS with a FastStore project.

### Set up your FastStore project

If you do not have a FastStore project, refer to the [Starting a new FastStore project](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-starting-the-project) guide.

### Set up CMS resources with your VTEX user role

You must have the following [resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) associated with your VTEX Admin [user role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) to be able to manage the Headless CMS:

| **Product** | **Category** | **Resource** |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| CMS | cms | See CMS menu on the top-bar |
| CMS | cms | Settings |
| CMS | GraphQL | CMS GraphQL API |
| VTEX IO | Infrastructure | Vbase Read Write |

To associate a role with the resources mentioned above, you can [create a custom role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role), add the resources to it, or add them to an existing role by editing it.

</Steps>

## Headless CMS

Headless CMS is a headless content management system that allows users to store content in a decoupled data layer and deliver it as structured data to their FastStore project via an API.

After onboarding through [FastStore WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview), users can manage their FastStore project on VTEX Admin by navigating to **Storefront > Headless CMS** under the [Projects](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/managing-projects--42IpDFqTVTESH8DCypJMPM) feature.

Each project lists all web pages created within it, starting empty and filling as editors add new pages. Each page corresponds to a unique URL and is identified by the following properties:

| Property name                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                               | Identifies a given page. This name is not available elsewhere and is used only internally in the Headless CMS for identification purposes.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Type** *(a.k.a., Content Type)*      | Determines the nature of a page. For example, the **Type** can be a Landing Page, a Product Listing Page (PLP), a Product Details Page (PDP), etc. You, as a developer, are the one responsible for defining which content types will be available for the editors of your store. |
| **Last modified**                      | Indicates the last time a given page was edited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Status**                            | Identifies the state of a page: <ul><li><code>Published</code>: Pages that are published and already available in the live store.</li> <li><code>Draft</code>: Pages that are in draft with work in progress and haven't been published yet.</li></ul>                            |

### Content Types

Once editors click **Create Document** in the Headless CMS interface, they'll be able to select a type from a list of **Content Types** that you, the developer, established.

### Sections

For each Content Type, different **Sections** will be available to compose that page. Sections represent the content structure of a React component, for example, the [Alert](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-alert).

Sections can be reused on different pages of an ecommerce. You are the one who will choose which Sections will be available at the CMS. Check the following example of the [Hero Section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-hero) being used:
