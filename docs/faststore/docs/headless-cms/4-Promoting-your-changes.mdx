In this final part of the track, let's ensure you promote your changes to production.
If you are happy with your Content type and Section, and definitions, you can put them on production by taking the following steps:

1. Open the terminal and switch to the `master` workspace.
    ```bash
    vtex use master
    ```
2. Change to the root directory of your FastStore project and sync your changes in the `cms` folder with the Headless CMS app.
    ```bash
    faststore cms-sync
    ```

Your FastStore project is now fully integrated with the Headless CMS, and editors will have the autonomy to create, edit, and publish web content via the VTEX Admin using the Headless CMS app.
