Let's set up all the tools you need to integrate the Headless CMS with your FastStore project. First, we will install the **VTEX IO CLI**.
The VTEX IO CLI will help you during your development process by allowing you to perform different actions in the VTEX platform. In the following, we will install and configure the Headless CMS app in your VTEX account.

## Before you begin

Before you proceed with setting up the Headless CMS in your account, make sure you:

<Steps>

### Install the Headless CMS, its dependencies and plugins

Ensure that you have installed the `vtex.admin-cms@1.x`, its dependencies and plugins as described in the [FastStore requirements](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements#install-headless-cms-and-its-dependencies).

### Successful FastStore Onboarding

Make sure the FastStore Onboarding process has been completed successfully through the FastStore WebOps . For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Starting a new FastStore project](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-2-setting-up-the-project) tutorial.

### Installation of VTEX IO CLI

Ensure that you have installed the VTEX IO CLI on your machine. This CLI is required to install the Headless CMS plugins and CMS dependencies. For more information, please refer to the [Installing VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-install) guide.

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Configuring the Headless CMS

Configure the URLs of the webhooks used by the Headless CMS app.

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Storefront > Headless CMS**. 
2. In the FastStore project interface, click on `Settings` (⚙️).
3. In **Settings**, click the `Build` tab.
4. In **Build Webhook URL**, click `Add`.
5. Enter the following value. _Replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario._

    ```bash
    https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.cms-builder-sf-jamstack/v1/{account}/master/build-releases
    ```

6. Click **SAVE**.
    
  > ℹ️ When an editor clicks to publish a page using the Headless CMS interface, the CMS calls the **Build Webhook URL**, which changes the page's status to `published`. The CMS then waits for the content to be built in the background.

7. Fill in the **Preview URL** field with your production URL. This URL activates the button on Headless CMS so you can preview the changes made on a page. _Replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario._

### Step 2 - Communicating WebOps updates to the Headless CMS

If you are developing your FastStore project with CI/CD and Headless CMS, you must ensure that CI/CD is aware of every CMS update performed via the VTEX Admin. To do so, you must configure the WebOps webhooks responsible for communicating with the Headless CMS as in the following.

1. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Edit the `faststore.config.js` file in the root directory of your project.
3. In the Headless CMS configuration, add the `webhookUrls` property corresponding to your store website as in the following:

    ```js faststore.config.js
    "vtexHeadlessCms": {
      webhookUrls: [
        "https://{account}.myvtex.com/cms-releases/webhook-releases"
      ]
    }
    ```

4. Open a Pull Request in your project, including the previous changes.
5. Merge the Pull Request.

Now you can make changes to the Headless CMS and check if commits are being created in the project. In the following example, the `Hero` title was modified to `10% off on first purchase`, and we can see that it generated a commit in the repository.
