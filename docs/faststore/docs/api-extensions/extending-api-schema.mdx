This guide will teach you how to extend VTEX and third-party APIs to suit your store's needs. By extending these APIs, you'll gain the ability to efficiently access and modify essential data, ensuring seamless customization to meet your specific needs.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Ensure consistency with API extension best practices

When extending the FastStore API schema, avoid overfetching data on your storefront. Refer to the [Best practices for fetching data on your storefront](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-overview#best-practices-for-fetching-data) for more information.

### Ensure your development server is active

Ensure that your development server is up and running while developing to observe changes promptly. Use the command `yarn dev` in the terminal to run the development server and monitor changes effectively.

</Steps>

## Extending VTEX API Schemas

FastStore streamlines the data utilization from VTEX APIs not directly exposed by the FastStore API.

Since FastStore uses GraphQL, you need to include [type definitions](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields) and [resolvers](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers) to fetch the desired data.
To define new type definitions and resolvers for FastStore using GraphQL, follow the instructions below.

### Instructions

#### Step 1 - Preparing the folders and files

To declare a new type definition and resolver, create the following directory structure:

1. In your store repository, go to the `src` folder and create the `graphql` subfolder. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   mkdir graphql
   ```

2. Inside the new `graphql` folder, create the `vtex` subfolder.

   ```bash
   mkdir vtex
   ```

3. In the `vtex` folder, create `resolvers` and `typeDefs` subfolders.

   ```bash
   mkdir resolvers typeDefs
   ```

   > ⚠️ The `src/graphql/vtex/resolvers` and `src/graphql/vtex/typeDefs` paths are mandatory, but you can organize the files inside those directories as you wish.

4. Create an `index.ts` file inside the `resolvers` folder.

Once you have created the necessary folders, you will have a folder structure for the VTEX API Schema Extensions in the `src/graphql/vtex` folder similar to the following:

		```ts
			starter.store/
			└─ src/
				└─ graphql/
					└─ vtex/
					├─ resolvers/
						└─ index.ts
						└─ <resolverName>.ts
						└─ …
					├─ typeDefs/
						└─<typeName>.graphql
						└─ …
		```

    	> ℹ️ Note that in the code example above, the type definitions and resolvers files were created at `<resolverName>.ts` and `<typeName>.graphql`.

#### Step 2 - Creating type definitions (`typeDefs`)

Your new type definitions set the data structure for your new fields, extended from the existing FastStore API GraphQL queries and types.

1. Create a new `<typeName>.graphql` file inside the `vtex/typeDefs` folder. For example, if we extend the [StoreProduct](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/schema-objects#storeproduct) type from the FastStore API, the name of the file should be `product.graphql`.

   > ℹ️ The organization inside the `vtex/typeDefs` folder is flexible. You can create multiple typeDefs files or group them all together in one file.
   > During the build process and when running the local server file, all `.graphql` files under this directory will be considered.

2. To extend `StoreProduct`, let's add a `customData` required field in `product.graphql`, which should return a string value. This field can store custom information related to a product in your store. For example, you might use this field to store additional product details that are not in the native FastStore API schema.

   ```graphql graphql/vtex/typeDefs/product.graphql
   extend type StoreProduct {
     """
     Custom data extending StoreProduct
     """
     customData: String!
   }
   ```

   > ⚠️ The typeDefs files must have a `.graphql` extension. Also, `index.ts` is necessary for resolvers but not required for typeDefs.

Refer to the next step to create the resolvers to provide the actual data to the `customData` field.

#### Step 3 - Creating resolvers

Now, you'll create a resolver to define how the new `customData` field should be resolved, specifically what data or logic should be associated with it when queried.

1.  Create a new `<resolver>.ts` file inside the `vtex/resolvers` folder. Let's continue using the [StoreProduct](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/schema-objects#storeproduct) type
    example. That means the name of the file will be `product.ts`.

        > ℹ️ The organization inside this folder is flexible. You can create multiple resolver files or group them all together in one file.

2.  Define the resolver in the `product.ts` file. This resolver specifies how to fetch the data for the `customData` field based on the root object, which represents the `StoreProduct`.

    ```ts graphql/vtex/resolvers/product.ts
    import type { StoreProductRoot } from "@faststore/api";

    const productResolver = {
      StoreProduct: {
        customData: (root: StoreProductRoot) => {
          return "My item id: " + root.itemId;
        },
      },
    };

    export default productResolver;
    ```

Note that you can leverage the use of TypeScript by typing the root param as [StoreProductRoot](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/root-object-fields#root-product):

3. Open the `index.ts` file inside the `vtex/resolvers` folder and import the resolver, `StoreProductResolver`, you created in the previous step.

4. Create a `resolvers` object that includes the imported resolvers.

   ```ts graphql/vtex/resolvers/index.ts
   import { default as StoreProductResolver } from "./product";

   const resolvers = {
     ...StoreProductResolver,
   };

   export default resolvers;
   ```

Once you have defined these files in the `vtex` folder, the new fields are available to use.

## Extending FastStore API with third-party API schemas

As stores grow, so does the possibility of consuming new data that is not provided by default in the FastStore API or other VTEX APIs.
This means your FastStore website may need to consume new data from third-party APIs.

### Instructions

#### Step 1 - Preparing the folders and files

	> ⚠️ If you already have the directory structure created in the [Extending VTEX API schemas](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-extending-api-schema), add the `thirdParty` folder inside `src/graphql`.

1. In your store repository, go to the `src` folder and create the `graphql` subfolder. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   mkdir graphql
   ```

2. Inside the new `graphql` folder, create the `thirdParty` subfolder.

   ```bash
   mkdir thirdParty
   ```

3. In `thirdParty`, create `resolvers` and `typeDefs` subfolders.

   ```bash
   mkdir resolvers typeDefs
   ```

   > ⚠️ The `src/graphql/vtex/resolvers` and `src/graphql/vtex/typeDefs` paths are mandatory, but you can organize the files inside those directories as you wish.

4. Create a `index.ts` file inside the `resolvers` folder.

   Once you have created the essentials folders, you will have a folder structure similiar to the the following:

   ```ts
   starter.store/
   └── src/
       └── graphql/
           ├── thirdParty/
           │   ├── resolvers/
           │       └── index.ts
           │       └── <resolverName>.ts
           │       └── …
           │   ├── typeDefs/
           │       └── <typeName>.graphql
           │       └── …
   ```

   > ℹ️ This directory structure distinguishes between data originating from VTEX and data from third-party APIs.

#### Step 2 - Creating type definitions and resolvers

1. Create a new `<typeName>.graphql` inside the `thirdParty` folder. As we are creating new queries, the name of the file that defines the type definitions can be `extra.graphql`.
2. Create a new `<resolver>.ts` file inside the `graphql/thirdParty/resolvers folder`.

#### Step 3 - Creating query or mutation schemas

When developing a third-party extension, it's essential to create a Query or Mutation schema. This schema is crucial for generating new query entry points to access data.
Below, you'll find a code example for implementing a third-party extension.

1. Create the `extra.graphql` file inside the `graphql/thirdParty/typeDefs` folder. The `extra.graphql` defines the type definitions in a GraphQL schema file.

   ```ts graphql/thirdParty/typeDefs/extra.graphql

   type ExtraData {
     """
     Data customizing ExtraData
     """
     data: String!
   }

   type Query {
     extraData: ExtraData
     namedExtraData(name: String!): ExtraData
   }
   ```

2. Create the `extra.ts` file inside the `graphql/thirdParty/resolvers` folder. This file defines the resolvers that handle the logic for the defined queries or mutations.

   ```ts graphql/thirdParty/resolvers/extra.ts
   const extraDataResolver = {
     Query: {
       extraData: () => {
         return {
           data: "Extra data",
         };
       },
       namedExtraData: (_, { name }) => {
         return {
           data: `Named extra data: ${name}`,
         };
       },
     },
   };

   export default extraDataResolver;
   ```

3. In the `graphql/thirdParty/resolvers` folder, create the `index.ts` file to combine all the resolvers into a single object.

   ```ts graphql/thirdParty/resolvers/index.ts
   import { default as StoreExtraResolver } from "./extra";

   const resolvers = {
     ...StoreExtraResolver,
   };

   export default resolvers;
   ```

4. With the schema and resolvers in place, query the data using GraphQL queries. Here's an example query to access the extra data:

   ```ts
   query {
   	extraData {
   		data
   	}
   	namedExtraData(name: "Hello") {
   		data
   	}
   }
   ```

Once you have defined these files in the `thirdParty` folder, you can query the specified data.
