This track will teach you how to extend the FastStore API schema by adding new data to the existing [queries](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/schema-queries).

While the [FastStore API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/faststore-api-overview) provides a [GraphQL schema](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/schema-queries) that caters to common use cases, some stores may require access to additional and more specific data. If you need to retrieve data not natively provided by the FastStore API, you can achieve this by extending the FastStore API schema and incorporating new data into the existing [queries](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/schema-queries).

  > ⚠️ Please be aware that introducing additional API endpoints to your storefront can potentially affect site performance, as already covered in the [Main concepts](#main-concepts) section. 

## Main concepts

<details>
<summary>GraphQL Optimizations & types</summary>

GraphQL optimizations are seamlessly executed, requiring no direct intervention from end developers. They are essential for optimizing your GraphQL server and TypeScript types and provide benefits such as:

- Build-time generated mappings of declared queries.
- Improved efficiency and security.
- Enforcement of predefined operations.

They are automatically triggered every time you start a development server (`yarn dev`) or build the store (`yarn build`).
Resolver changes are automatically and instantly visible without the need for manual optimization generation.
Without these optimizations, any changes to the GraphQL schema, such as adding or removing fields from a query or changing a GraphQL type, won't be reflected in the store. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>Extendable queries</summary>

Extendable queries in FastStore's GraphQL API are predefined GraphQL queries that serve as a foundation for retrieving data from the API. 
These queries allow you to add or change fields within the query to tailor the data retrieval process to the store-specific needs.

</details>

### Fetch only the data you need

GraphQL allows you to customize your query to get precisely the data you need, which reduces the data returned from the requests. Double-check your queries to make sure they are not over-fetching.

This also means that you must be mindful of the data added to your query with [GraphQL fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) returned. Use them only when they do not include unnecessary data.

### Optimize FastStore API integration with VTEX APIs

When integrating FastStore with VTEX APIs, always use your store's domain for API calls instead of `vtexcommercestable` environment directly. Direct calls for this environment can impact performance and scalability. 

For example, when using the [Get list of products for a query instead](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/intelligent-search-api#get-/product_search/-facets-?endpoint=get-/product_search/-facets-) endpoint, instead of calling `https://mystore.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/io/_v/api/intelligent-search/product_search/{facets}`, use your store's domain like `https://www.mystore.com/api/io/_v/api/intelligent-search/product_search/{facets}`.

### Do not send direct requests to external APIs

Do not make direct requests to external APIs to avoid compromising website performance and `504` timeout errors. Instead, use the FastStore [API extension](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-extending-api-schema) to access other data not available in the native FastStore API schema.

If you need data that is not available on the native FastStore GraphQL schema, check the [root object](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/schema-objects).
The [GraphQL root object](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers) represents the top-level object returned to a query. You can see the data that is available in the root object by adding logs.


### Avoid custom API Routes

We do not recommend using Next.js [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) other than the ones already built-in  in FastStore.

If you do use this type of function, you must always check which ones are actually running and remove the ones that are not.
