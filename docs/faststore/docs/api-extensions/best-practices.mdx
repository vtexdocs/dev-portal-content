title: 'Best practices for using API extensions'
---
 
The[ `@faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) package version 3.x introduces enhancements to API extension with a more efficient GraphQL query handling and security measures enhancements. 

In this guide, learn to configure API extensions, ensuring the following:

    - Use the `gql` helper usage for smoother and more efficient GraphQL query handling.

    - Implement a more secure method for invoking queries and mutations to safeguard your store's data.

    - Optimize call processes for queries or mutations defined within `@faststore/core`.
 
## Before you begin

Make sure your store version is updated to v3.0.0 or above.  If itâ€™s not updated, refer to the [Updating your `@faststore/core` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-core-package-version) section. 

## Updating the `gql` helper usage

The `gql` helper serves as a function to define GraphQL operations such as queries, mutations, or fragments within the store code. See the example below:

    ```tsx /fragments/ClientProduct.tsx
    import { gql } from '@faststore/graphql-utils'

    export const fragment = gql`
        fragment ClientProduct on Query {
            product(locator: $locator) {
            id: productID
            breadcrumbList {
                itemListElement {
                    item
                    name
                    position
                }
            }
        }
    }
    `
    ```

Import the `gql` helper from `@faststore/core/api`and call it as a function - with the argument between parenthesis. This also applies to query and mutation definitions inside the components. For example:

    ```tsx fragments/ClientProduct.tsx
    import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'

    export const fragment = gql(`
        fragment ClientProduct on Query {
            product(locator: $locator) {
                id: productID
                breadcrumbList {
                    itemListElement {
                        item
                        name
                        position
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    `)
    ```

## Using `useQuery` hook to call queries and mutations
Queries, and mutations are must be invoked using secure hashes, which are randomly generated. To that, pass the query or mutation object - the result of the `gql` call - to `useQuery` directly. For example:

    ```tsx
    import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'
    import { useQuery_unstable as useQuery } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

    const query = gql(`
    query MyCustomQuery {
        customQuery() {
        data
        }
    }
    `)

    // useQuery apropriately calls MyCustomQuery
    function CustomComponent() {
        // ...
        const result = useQuery(query, variables)
        // ...
    }
    ```

## Calling queries or mutations defined by `@faststore/core`

A custom component can call a query or mutation defined by `@faststore/core`, such as `ClientManyProductsQuery`. In these cases, replace the `useQuery` hook call with a call to the specific hook for that query. 

    ```tsx
    import { useClientManyProducts_unstable as useClientManyProducts } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

    // ClientManyProductsQuery will be called with the variables passed by CustomComponent
    function CustomComponent() {
        // ...
        const result = useClientManyProducts(variables)
        // ...
    }
    ```
