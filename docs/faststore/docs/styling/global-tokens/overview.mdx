title: 'Global Tokens'
---

Design Tokens are parameters that affect all UI look 'n' feel, and they are the main configuration file of a Theme. Component-specific tokens often inherit from global tokens but are named specifically to apply those tokens in component development.

## Global Tokens

FastStore uses a default theme called `Brandless`, which provides structural styles for your components and pages. Please read [Brandless's page](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/using-themes-overview#brandless-and-the-theming-structure) for further information about the themeable architecture.

Its presets are defined on `src/base/tokens.scss` in [@faststore/ui](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/blob/main/packages/ui/src/styles/base/tokens.scss), and it's separated in these main areas:
