Customize a component's styling using design tokens that align with your store's branding. In this guide, you'll learn how to customize the style of a FastStore component using its local tokens. For this tutorial, we will use the `Listing` variant from the [Price Component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-price).

This is how prices look like in our current homepage (with the default color black) :

![homepage-prices-default-color-black](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/homepage-prices-default___2751f604ab85b1dcfa47c942e318a7cd.png)

> ℹ️ Remember that when changing a component's style, you can use [Global tokens](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/global-tokens-overview) or styling from scratch using your preferred styling tool. However, changing the value of a global token may affect different parts of your store's interface.

1. In your `custom-theme.scss` theme file, add the `data-fs-price` data attribute:

```scss src/themes/custom-theme.scss
  ...
  // --------------------------------------------------------
  // FS UI Components
  // --------------------------------------------------------
  // Add here the customizations for FastStore UI components.
  [data-fs-price] {}
```

> ℹ️ Each FastStore UI component has a list of data attributes that can be used for further customization. You can find it in the component's [customization section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-price#customization).

2. Now, add the `Listing` variant using the `Price` [local token](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-price#design-tokens). For this tutorial, we will use the shade of red `#cb4242`:

```scss src/themes/custom-theme.scss mark=6

  ...
  // --------------------------------------------------------
  // FS UI Components
  // --------------------------------------------------------
    [data-fs-price] {
      --fs-price-listing-color: #cb4242;
    }
```

3. Save your changes and check your browser to see the new color of your listing price. You may need to refresh the page.

![homepage-prices-listing-red](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/homepage-prices-design-token-red___cd0b15da26d23e0d0f4a2bd68ae6ca14.png)

Since we are not specifying the `Price` component context, we are applying this change to all the `Price (data-fs-price)` occurrences where the variant is `listing`.
If you want to apply this change in only one store component, follow the next step [Customizing a component within a section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/using-themes-components#customizing-a-component-within-a-section).

## Customizing a component within a section

The starter provides a set of [native sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections), each consisting of different components with unique functionalities. You can customize the components inside its section using the available section and the component's data attributes.

In the example below, we will change the color of the [Price](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-price#customization) component with the `listing` variant.
However, we only want to apply this change to the `ProductShelf` section. So, we can use the `data-fs-product-shelf` data-attribute to select the [ProductShelf component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-product-shelf#customization) in this section.

1. In your `custom-theme.scss` theme file , add the following code:

```scss src/themes/custom-theme.scss mark=8:12

  ...
  // --------------------------------------------------------
  // FS UI Components
  // --------------------------------------------------------
  [data-fs-price] {
    --fs-price-listing-color: #cb4242;
  }
  [data-fs-product-shelf]{
    [data-fs-price][data-fs-price-variant="listing"] {
      background-color: var(--fs-color-warning-bkg);
    }
  }
```

2. Save your changes and check your browser to see a yellow background color added to listing prices inside the `ProductShelf`. You may need to refresh the page.

![homepage-prices-section-background](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/homepage-prices-section-background___a71b4bbf2239e560c8d61bf66cb6395d.png)

Notice that in this example, only one section, the `ProductShelf,` received the change. You can use this same approach whenever you need to sync FastStore UI Components.

## Customizing a new component when using override

To customize a native component in FastStore to suit your store's needs, you can use the **override** feature.
When [overriding a native component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-components-and-props-v1#overriding-a-native-component) and using your custom component,
you may need to style it from scratch. In this section, you'll learn how to style a custom component.

### Before you begin

Make sure you have a basic understanding of [overriding native components and props](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-components-and-props-v1).
Additionally, we recommend using [CSS Module](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules) to style your new component.

> ℹ️ FastStore components support [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling by default, but you can work with your desired tool.

For better understanding, we will use the example from the [Overriding Native Components and Props](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-components-and-props-v1) guide.
This example demonstrates how to create a new `BuyButton`, the `CustomBuyButton` in the `ProductDetails` section.
To follow along this section, make sure to create the `CustomBuyButton`.

### Instructions

1. Once you have created the `CustomBuyButton` component, create a new file called `CustomBuyButtons.module.scss`.

![custom-buy-button-component-code](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/custom-buy-button-component-code___25c01fd818e1fab4247e1f0f77df4186.png)

2. Add the following code to the `CustomBuyButtons.module.scss` file:

```scss CustomBuyButton.module.scss
.CustomBuyButton {
  --fs-button-border-radius: var(--fs-border-radius-pill);
  --fs-button-padding:  0 var(--fs-spacing-5);

  color: var(--fs-color-text-inverse);

  [data-fs-button-wrapper] {
    background-color: #E31C58;
  }
}
```

> ℹ️ You can use FastStore UI components' customization data attribute to ease your styling process. In this example, we used `data-fs-button-wrapper`.

To ensure visual consistency with your store's theme, we highly recommend utilizing the [global tokens](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/global-tokens-overview) whenever possible. You can also take advantage of the design tokens set provided by [FastStore UI Components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/components-index).

3. Restart the server and check the color and shape of your `CustomBuyButton` component:
