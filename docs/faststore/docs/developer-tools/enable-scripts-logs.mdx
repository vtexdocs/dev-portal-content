title: "Debug logging for third-party scripts"
---

> ⚠️ This is an experimental feature.

The `enableScriptsLogs` flag helps you troubleshoot third-party scripts and analytics behavior in FastStore by adding debug logs to the browser console.

Use this feature when you need more visibility into script execution and event payloads during development or staging validation.

## Before you begin

We recommend enabling this flag only in development or staging environments. This feature increases browser console output and may make debugging noisier if left enabled all the time.

## Step 1: Update FastStore packages

Update the FastStore packages to the latest version:

```sh
yarn upgrade -L --scope @faststore
```

## Step 2: Enable `enableScriptsLogs`

1. Open your `discovery.config.js` file.
2. In the `experimental` object, set `enableScriptsLogs` to `true`.

```js discovery.config.js mark=1:3
...
experimental: {
  ...
  enableScriptsLogs: true,
}
```

## Step 3: Validate logs in the browser

1. Open your store in a development or staging environment.
2. Open browser Developer Tools and go to the **Console** tab.
3. Filter logs by `vtex` to quickly locate FastStore script logs.
4. Navigate through key storefront flows, such as:
   - Search for a product and open a product page.
   - Trigger actions that send analytics events.
   - Validate GTM events during debugging sessions.
5. Confirm logs are being emitted with expected payload structure.

With this flag enabled, you should see logs related to:

- Partytown debug and forwarded calls.
- Google Tag Manager (GTM) `dataLayer.push` events.
- VTEX Request Capture (`sendrc`) and Activity Flow calls.
- Intelligent Search Events payloads.
