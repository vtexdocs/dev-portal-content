The `discovery.config.js` is a configuration file for managing various settings that control store behavior, appearance, and functionality. This file serves as a central hub for configuring key aspects of your FastStore website, including SEO, API connections, session management, analytics, and more.

This guide outlines the configuration options for tailoring your FastStore website using the `discovery.config.js` file.
## Example file

```javascript
module.exports = {
  seo: {
    title: "FastStore Starter",
    description: "Fast Demo Store",
    titleTemplate: "%s | FastStore",
    author: "FastStore",
  },
  theme: "custom-theme",
  platform: "vtex",
  api: {
    storeId: "storeframework",
    workspace: "master",
    environment: "vtexcommercestable",
    hideUnavailableItems: false,
    incrementAddress: false,
  },
};
```
