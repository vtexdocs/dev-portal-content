title: 'FastStore CLI'
---

The FastStore Command Line Interface (CLI) provides pre-configured scripts for starting, building, and developing FastStore projects. It also helps keep FastStore projects up to date with the [`@faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) package.

## Before you begin

To ensure the FastStore CLI commands related to the Headless CMS run correctly, make sure to install the Headless CMS, its dependencies and plugins as described in the [FastStore requirements](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements).

## Running FastStore CLI on the project

The CLI is automatically added as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file, so once you run `yarn install` during the [project setup](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-2-setting-up-the-project), you can start using it in the project.

## Installing FastStore CLI globally

To use FastStore CLI commands globally on your machine, install the [`@faststore/cli`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-project-structure#faststorecli) package:

<Tabs items={["yarn", "npm"]} defaultIndex="0">
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn global add @faststore/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -g @faststore/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



## Default commands
Below is a brief description of the default commands available in the FastStore CLI. To view detailed information about each command, click the respective command name.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Running the commands through `yarn` is enough to develop your store. However, to set up your project with Headless CMS and create new sections, you need to install the FastStore CLI globally and use its commands.

| Command name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`build`](#build) | Generates a production-ready storefront. It compiles the project and optimizes it for production usage. |
| [`cms-sync`](#cms-sync) | Syncs the `cms` folder of your FastStore project with [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview). |
| [`dev`](#dev) | Starts the project in the development environment and uses `http://localhost:3000` as the default server. It allows you to make changes to the project and see the results locally in real time without affecting the production environment. |
| [`generate`](#generate) | Optimizes the schema and re-generates TypeScript types so recent changes take effect without restarting dev. |
| [`help`](#help) | Displays help for FastStore CLI commands. |
| [`start`](#start) | Executes the FastStore project in the root directory and uses `http://localhost:3000` as the default server. |
