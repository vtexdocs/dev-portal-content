title: "Enabling URL redirects"
---

> ⚠️ This is an experimental feature. 

Redirects automatically send users from one URL to another. This is helpful when a page has been moved, renamed, or removed. For instance, if a page is relocated or renamed, the redirect ensures the user reaches the new location.

In this guide, learn how to enable the redirect feature for FastStore.

## Before you begin

Update your FastStore project to version `3.2.0` or higher. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in a code editor.

2. Open a terminal and run the following command to update the FastStore packages to the latest version:
	
	```bash
    yarn upgrade -L --scope @faststore
    ```

## Instructions

1. Open your FastStore project in your preferred code editor and navigate to the `discovery.config.js` file in the project directory.
2. Open the `discovery.config.js` file.
3. Within the `experimental` section, add `enableRedirects: true` to enable the redirects feature in the project, for example:

    ```js discovery.config.js mark=5
    …
    experimental: {
        ...
        enableRedirects: true,
    },
    …
    ```

4. Run `yarn dev` to check for errors before deploying this change to production. Make sure to address any errors before deployment.
5. Create a new branch and open a pull request to deploy the changes made in the `discovery.config.js` file to production.

Once the change is live, you can manage the store’s redirects in VTEX Admin by following the instructions in [Managing URL redirects](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/managing-url-redirects--3UJuFrU8imSVWg134mkvJV)
