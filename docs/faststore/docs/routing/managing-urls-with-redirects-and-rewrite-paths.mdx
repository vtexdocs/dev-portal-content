title: "Managing URLs with redirects and rewrite paths"
---

In this guide, you will learn how to configure redirects and rewrites in your FastStore project to manage users' access to your content.

Redirects are used to take users from one URL to another automatically. This is useful when a page has been moved, renamed, or removed. For example, if a page has been moved or renamed, the redirect ensures the user is taken to the new location.

Rewrites allow you to map custom URLs to existing page templates without changing the URL in the browser. This is useful when you want to hide complex or dynamic URL structures from users while maintaining clean and SEO-friendly URLs. For example, you can map a custom URL, such as `/sale`, to an existing Product Listing Page (PLP) template.

In summary:

- Redirects change both the URL the user sees and the destination.
- Rewrites keep the URL the same but change the destination internally.

These two tools enhance content organization, help maintain a good user experience, and ensure search engines continue to index the correct content.

## Creating redirects

FastStore allows you to configure redirects through the [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) file. This configuration is based on [Next.js redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects).

> ⚠️ Projects hosted on Vercel have redirect limits such as, "Number of redirects in the array: 1,024 maximum" and "String length for `source` and `destination` parameters: 4.096 maximum." For more information, check the Vercel [Redirects](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/redirects#configuration) article.

1. Open your FastStore project in your preferred code editor and go to the `discovery.config.js` file within your project directory.
2. Inside the `discovery.config.js`, add the `redirects`  function. This function will define your redirect rules, for example:

    ```discovery.config.js mark=3:6
    account: "{accountName}",
    …
    async redirects() {
        const redirects = require('./src/redirects.json');
        return redirects;
    },
    ```

    > ℹ️ The `redirects` function requires the `required.json` file, which you will create in the next step. This file contains the redirect definitions.

3. Go to the `src` folder and create the `redirects.json` file. In the `redirects.json` file, add the following:

    ```src/redirects.json
    [
    {
        "source": "/office",
        "destination": "/about",
        "permanent": true
    }
    ]
    ```

    | Property name | Description |
    | ------------------- | --------------- |
    | `source` | Original URL pattern that triggers the redirect. In this example, any URL starting with `/office` will be redirected. |
    | `destination` | New URL to which users will be sent. Here, `/about` is the destination for users coming from `/office`. |
    | `permanent` | The type of redirect. Set to `true` for a permanent (308 status code) redirect, which search engines will cache. Set to `false` for a temporary (307 status code) redirect. |

    > ℹ️ For more information about each property, access the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects) documentation.

4. Run `yarn dev`  to start your project in development mode.
5. Open a browser and go to the old URL (e.g., `/office`). If the redirect is set up correctly, you should be automatically redirected to the new URL (e.g., `/about`).

## (Experimental) Enabling redirects using the `enableRedirects` flag

For projects requiring more than 1024 redirects, you can enable the `enableRedirects` flag in the `discovery.config.js` file. This flag lets you manage redirects through [redirects](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/managing-url-redirects) in the VTEX Admin.

> ⚠️ This workflow, which uses both a code configuration and the [redirects](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/managing-url-redirects) interface.

1. Update your FastStore project to version `3.2.0` or higher. To do this, open your project in a code editor.

2. Open a terminal and run the following command to update the FastStore packages to the latest version:
	
	```bash
    yarn upgrade -L --scope @faststore
    ```

3. With your FastStore project open, navigate to the `discovery.config.js` file in the project directory.
4. Open the `discovery.config.js` file.
5. Within the `experimental` section, add `enableRedirects: true` to enable the redirects feature in the project, for example:

    ```js discovery.config.js mark=5
    …
    experimental: {
        ...
        enableRedirects: true,
    },
    …
    ```

4. Run `yarn dev` to check for errors before deploying this change to production. Make sure to address any errors before deployment.
5. Create a new branch and open a pull request to deploy the changes made in the `discovery.config.js` file to production.

Once the change is live, you can manage the store’s redirects in VTEX Admin by following the instructions in [Managing URL redirects](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/managing-url-redirects--3UJuFrU8imSVWg134mkvJV).
 
## Creating rewrites

FastStore leverages [Next.js rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) to create custom routes while using existing Product Listing Page (PLP) templates. This allows you to map specific URLs to templates defined in Headless CMS, providing flexibility in content organization and URL structure.

For more information on using rewrites with PLP templates, check the [Using rewrites with PLP template](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-multiple-page-template#product-listing-page-plp-template-selection-criteria) section on the Multiple page templates documentation.
