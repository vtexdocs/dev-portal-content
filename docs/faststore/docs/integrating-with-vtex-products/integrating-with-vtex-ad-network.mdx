# Integrating FastStore with VTEX Ad Network

> ⚠️ This feature is available only for stores using the [VTEX Ad Network](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-ad-network-beta--2cgqXcBuJmXN2livQvClur) solution. To enable it, contact [Commercial Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/3KQWGgkPOwbFTPfBxL7YwZ) and request the app to be installed on your VTEX account.

FastStore stores can display sponsored products through the [VTEX Ad Network](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-ad-network-beta--2cgqXcBuJmXN2livQvClur) when using [Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/intelligent-search-overview--5o8ixTpYIxx3uJD0B1xp3z). Follow the steps below to enable sponsored product display in your store.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update the `@faststore/cli` package

Update your store FastStore package to `v3.0.117` using `@faststore/cli`. To update the package, see the [Updating the`@fastore/cli` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-cli-package-version) for further details.

### Create a campaign 

Create a campaign with valid products to be displayed to the store. To do this, follow the instructions on the [Creating campaigns](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/advertising-with-vtex-ad-network-beta--5WoXcJzHc7EQElpPjziqse#creating-campaigns) tutorial.

</Steps>

## Instructions

1. Open your FastStore project in a code editor and go to `discovery.config.js` file.
2. In the `discovery.config.js` file, add the following configuration for `api`:

  ``` js
    api: {
       ...
       showSponsored: true,
     },
  ```

    > ℹ️ The `showSponsored` configuration in the store's settings enables the Intelligent Search to return sponsored products.


3. Open your terminal and run the `yarn dev` command to apply the configuration.
4. Access your store locally by using the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000/`).
5. On the store website, search for a product included in the [VTEX Ad Network campaign](#create-a-campaign). The example below shows the **Fantastic Concrete Shirt** as the sponsored product.

> ℹ Sponsored products may appear more than once, depending on advertiser settings.

6. To apply your configuration to the production store, create a new branch and commit your changes.
7. Open a pull request for the branch in your store's GitHub repository.
8. Review and merge the pull request into the main branch.
