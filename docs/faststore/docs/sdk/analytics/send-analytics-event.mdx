title: "sendAnalyticsEvent"
---

The `sendAnalyticsEvent` function triggers events in the browser, following the [Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data model](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events). This function is primarily used for ecommerce tracking but also supports custom events, serving as a centralized point for managing events.

{ /* Remember to add a link to 'custom events' once we have the following task done: EDU-13545 */ }

> ⚠️ `sendAnalyticsEvent` doesn't send events to any analytics provider. To intercept events triggered by this function, use the [`useAnalyticsEvent`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/analytics-use-analytics-event) hook.

## Import

```tsx
import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'
```

## Usage

In the component related to the event, declare a callback function. In this function, define an event object with the desired event type (example: `add_to_cart`) and call `sendAnalyticsEvent`. Then, pass the related event as an argument. Finally, call the callback function in the event trigger (example: `onClick`).

Consider the following example of an `add_to_cart` event triggered by the `button` component:

```tsx
import { useCallback } from 'react'
import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const addToCartCallback = useCallback(() => {
   import('@faststore/sdk').then(({ sendAnalyticsEvent }) => {
    /* ... */

    const addToCartEvent = {
      name: 'add_to_cart',
      params: {
        items: [
          /* ... */
        ],
      },
    }

    sendAnalyticsEvent(addToCartEvent)
    })
  }, [])

  return <button onClick={addToCartCallback}>Add to cart</button>
}
```

## Parameters

The `sendAnalyticsEvent` function accepts an event object with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | `string` | The name of the event that appears in Analytics reports. | Required |
| `params` | `object` | Event-specific parameters and data. | Required |
| `isEcommerceEvent` | `boolean` | Determines event structure. When `true`, wraps `params` in an `ecommerce` object following the GA4 ecommerce data model. When `false`, sends `params` at the top level for custom non-ecommerce events. | `true` |

### Using custom events without ecommerce structure

By default, `sendAnalyticsEvent` wraps event parameters in an `ecommerce` object to follow the [Google Analytics 4 ecommerce events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/14434488?hl=en) structure. However, for custom events that don't represent ecommerce actions, you should set `isEcommerceEvent: false` to send parameters at the top level, following the [GA4 custom events format](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/14240153?hl=en).

#### Example: Custom event with `isEcommerceEvent: false`

```tsx
import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

sendAnalyticsEvent({
  name: 'newsletter_signup',
  isEcommerceEvent: false,
  params: {
    method: 'footer_form',
    user_type: 'new_visitor',
    email_preference: 'weekly'
  }
})
```

This sends the event as:

```json
{
  "event": "newsletter_signup",
  "method": "footer_form",
  "user_type": "new_visitor",
  "email_preference": "weekly"
}
```

#### Example: Ecommerce event (default behavior)

```tsx
import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

sendAnalyticsEvent({
  name: 'add_to_cart',
  params: {
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 29.99,
    items: [{ item_id: '12345', item_name: 'Product Name' }]
  }
})
```

This sends the event as:

```json
{
  "event": "add_to_cart",
  "ecommerce": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "value": 29.99,
    "items": [{ "item_id": "12345", "item_name": "Product Name" }]
  }
}
```

## Exporting custom event types with generics

The `sendAnalyticsEvent` function supports generics, enabling you to extend default types or modify existing ones. This approach provides type-checking and code suggestions for your custom event properties.

Consider the following example of providing a custom type reference for `sendAnalyticsEvent`:

```tsx
import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

interface CustomEvent {
  name: 'custom_event'
  params: {
    customProperty?: string
  }
}

/**
 * By passing CustomEvent as a generic type to sendAnalyticsEvent, you'll receive code hints for all properties of this type, including params subfields.
 */
sendAnalyticsEvent<CustomEvent>(/* ... */)
```
