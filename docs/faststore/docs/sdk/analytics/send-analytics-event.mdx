---

The `sendAnalyticsEvent` function triggers events in the browser, following the [Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data model](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events). This function is primarily used for ecommerce tracking but also supports custom events, serving as a centralized point for managing events.

{ /* Remember to add a link to 'custom events' once we have the following task done: EDU-13545 */ }

> ⚠️ `sendAnalyticsEvent` doesn't send events to any analytics provider. To intercept events triggered by this function, use the [`useAnalyticsEvent`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/analytics-use-analytics-event) hook.

## Import

```tsx
import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'
```

## Usage

In the component related to the event, declare a callback function. In this function, define an event object with the desired event type (example: `add_to_cart`) and call `sendAnalyticsEvent`. Then, pass the related event as an argument. Finally, call the callback function in the event trigger (example: `onClick`).

Consider the following example of an `add_to_cart` event triggered by the `button` component:

```tsx
import { useCallback } from 'react'
import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const addToCartCallback = useCallback(() => {
   import('@faststore/sdk').then(({ sendAnalyticsEvent }) => {
    /* ... */

    const addToCartEvent = {
      name: 'add_to_cart',
      params: {
        items: [
          /* ... */
        ],
      },
    }

    sendAnalyticsEvent(addToCartEvent)
    })
  }, [])

  return <button onClick={addToCartCallback}>Add to cart</button>
}
```

Check the list of [available types](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/analytics-overview#list-of-native-event-types).

## Exporting custom event types with generics

The `sendAnalyticsEvent` function supports generics, enabling you to extend default types or modify existing ones. This approach provides type-checking and code suggestions for your custom event properties.

Consider the following example of providing a custom type reference for `sendAnalyticsEvent`:

```tsx
import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

interface CustomEvent {
  name: 'custom_event'
  params: {
    customProperty?: string
  }
}

/**
 * By passing CustomEvent as a generic type to sendAnalyticsEvent, you'll receive code hints for all properties of this type, including params subfields.
 */
sendAnalyticsEvent<CustomEvent>(/* ... */)
```
