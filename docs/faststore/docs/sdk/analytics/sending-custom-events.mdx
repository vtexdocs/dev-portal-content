title: "Sending custom events"
---

Even though the [Analytics](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/analytics-overview) module natively supports [Google Analytics ecommerce events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/14434488?hl=en), you may need to track customer activity not covered by default events. In such cases, you can trigger and intercept custom events using the [`sendAnalyticsEvent`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/analytics-send-analytics-event) and [`useAnalyticsEvent`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/analytics-use-analytics-event) functions. In this guide, learn how to define and send custom events.

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Declaring an interface for your custom event

To trigger a custom event, you must define an interface that describes the structure of your event object, including its properties and types. There are three approaches to doing this:

- [Creating a new event interface](#creating-a-new-event-interface)
- [Extending existing types from the Analytics Module](#extending-existing-types-from-the-analytics-module)
- [Overriding Multiple Types](#overriding-multiple-types)

#### Creating a new event interface

To create a custom event interface, use the `sendAnalyticsEvent` function. This function requires the event to include two properties:

| Property name | Type | Description |
| ------------------- |-------- |---------------- |
| `name`            | `string` | The name of the event that appears in Analytics reports. The `name` doesn't need to follow any event name conventions related to natively supported events. |
| `params` | `any` | Any type and value your custom event uses. |

##### Example

In the following example, we define a custom event called `WishlistEvent` to track when a user adds a product to their wishlist:

    ```ts
    import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

    interface WishlistEvent {
        name: 'wishlist-event',
        params: {
        productId: string
        productName: string
        }
        userId: string
        isLoggedIn: boolean
    }

    sendAnalyticsEvent<WishlistEvent>({ name, params, userId, isLoggedIn })
    ```

This custom event interface captures when a user adds a product to their wishlist, logging details like `productId`, `productName`, and whether the user is logged in (`isLoggedIn`). This data can then be sent to your analytics tool to better understand customer behavior, such as which products are popular on wishlists and how engagement varies between logged-in and anonymous users.

#### Extending existing types from the Analytics module

If your event is related to an existing one, you can extend relevant types from the Analytics module. You can do this by using the [TypeScript generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) with the [`sendAnalyticsEvent`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/analytics-send-analytics-event) function.

##### Example

The following example extends the `AddToCartEvent` interface to include the `couponCode` property, which is useful for tracking if a customer applied a coupon code when adding an item to the cart:

    ```ts
    import type { AddToCartEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'
    import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

    interface AddToCartExtended extends AddToCartEvent {
        couponCode: string
    }

    /* ... */

    sendAnalyticsEvent<AddToCartExtended>({ name, params, couponCode })
    ```

#### Overriding multiple types

If you have multiple custom events, such as adding/removing items from the cart or viewing products, you can define a unified type to handle them all. This approach simplifies firing multiple events from the same interface.

    ```ts
    /* types.ts */
    import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

    type AddToCartExtended = /* ... */
    type RemoveFromCartExtended = /* ... */
    type ViewItemExtended = /* ... */
    type SelectItemExtended = /* ... */

    type ExtendedEvents =
    | AddToCartExtended
    | RemoveFromCartExtended
    | ViewItemExtended
    | SelectItemExtended

    type SendExtendedAnalyticsEvent = (event: ExtendedEvents) => void

    export const sendExtendedAnalyticsEvent: SendExtendedAnalyticsEvent = (event) =>
    sendAnalyticsEvent<ExtendedEvents>(event)
    ```

    ```ts
    /* MyComponent.tsx */
    import { sendExtendedAnalyticsEvent } from './types'

    /* ... */

    sendExtendedAnalyticsEvent({ /* Extended event object */})
    ```

The example above sets up a flexible way to fire multiple custom events. Instead of managing multiple event types separately, the purpose of the example is to handle them all through a single interface. You can use this setup to track diverse customer interactions, such as adding/removing products from the cart, viewing products, or saving items to the wishlist.

### Step 2 - Intercepting custom events

After defining the event interface, you'll need to intercept these events using the `useAnalyticsEvent` hook. Below is an example of how to set up an event handler:

    ```ts
    import { useAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

    import type { ArbitraryEvent } from './types'

    export const AnalyticsHandler = () => {
    useAnalyticsEvent((event: ArbitraryEvent) => {
    })

    /* ... */

    return null
    }
    ```

Note that to target extended properties of events, you'll also need to configure the types of your [`useAnalyticsEvent`](/reference/sdk/analytics/useAnalyticsEvent) callback function to expect an event of such type.

    ```ts
    import { useAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

    import type { ExtendedEvents } from './types'

    export const AnalyticsHandler = () => {

    useAnalyticsEvent((event: ExtendedEvents) => {
        /* ... */
    })

    /* ... */

    return null
    }
    ```

> â„¹ By typing the callback function with the extended types, you can reference properties not natively offered by the analytics module.

### Step 3 - Firing custom events

Now that you have declared your event interface and intercepted it with the `useAnalyticsEvent` hook, you can implement it in your components to fire the event.

    ```ts
    import { useCallback } from 'react'
    import { sendAnalyticsEvent } from '@faststore/sdk'

    const MyComponent = () => {
    const arbitraryEvent = useCallback(() => {
        /* ... */

        const arbitraryEvent = {
        type: 'arbitrary-event',
        data: {
            items: [
            /* ... */
            ],
        },
        }

        sendAnalyticsEvent(arbitraryEvent)
    }, [])

    return <button onClick={arbitraryEvent}>Arbitrary button</button>
    }
    ```
