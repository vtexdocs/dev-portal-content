The FastStore SDK is a toolkit that provides functions and interfaces for managing the state of key ecommerce features in the browser context. Providing a set of functions and interfaces simplifies tasks like tracking cart items and handling user sessions.

The SDK is organized into four modules with specific properties and behaviors. This track provides more details about each module.

- [Cart](#cart)
- [Session](#session)
- [Search](#search)
- [Analytics](#analytics)

  - [Inspecting browser data](#inspecting-browser-data)

## Cart

The Cart module controls the state of the shopping cart data structure in the shopper's browser. You can use it to add items to the cart, remove items, and clear the cart, among other tasks. {/* Learn more about [Cart](LINK) module. */}

> ℹ️ Learn more about validating the cart in the shopper browser against the information in the platform with [FastStore API mutations](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/schema-mutations#cart).

## Session

The Session module manages the state of session information in the shopper browser. This includes currency, channel, localization, and shopper information. {/* Learn more about the [Session module](LINK) data structure and usage. */}

## Search

The Search module offers functions for implementing a faceted search based on URL parameters. Whenever a shopper searches your store or changes the selected facets, the search module generates a unique and serialized URL and then directs the user to that URL.

## Analytics

The Analytics module helps you create a simple, extensive event system to feed your data pool. It is geared towards [Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4) but supports other analytics providers.

## Getting started with the FastStore SDK

Install [`@faststore/sdk`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) as a dependency of your FastStore project via the command line:

<CH.Code>

```bash
yarn add @faststore/sdk
```

</CH.Code>

### Usage

The FastStore SDK makes available different functions and hooks to manage essential ecommerce features. To use these functions and hooks, import them from the `@faststore/sdk` package.

The following example demonstrates how to manage a shopping cart using the `useCart` hook. It focuses on adding an item to the cart and displaying the cart's contents.

<CH.Code>

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useCart } from '@faststore/sdk'

const NewComponent = () => {
  const { addItem, items } = useCart()

  const product = {
    id: '123',
    itemOffered: { name: 'Wireless Headphones' },
    price: 99.99,
    quantity: 1,
  }

  const handleAddToCart = () => {
    addItem(product)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.itemOffered.name}</h1>
      <p>${product.price}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>

      <h2>Cart Summary</h2>
      {items.length === 0 ? (
        <p>Your cart is empty.</p>
      ) : (
        items.map((item) => (
          <div key={item.id}>
            <p>{item.itemOffered.name} - ${item.price} (Qty: {item.quantity})</p>
          </div>
        ))
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default NewComponent
```

</CH.Code>

In the example, if the cart is empty, it shows a message indicating that the cart is empty. However, if the cart contains items, it lists each item's name, price, and quantity.

### Inspecting browser data

You can inspect browser data related to the session and shopping cart managed by the SDK when running your project locally. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Run the command `yarn dev` from the root of your FastStore project.
2. Open your local project preview at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Open the browser's developer console and run the following commands:

   - To view session data: `faststore_sdk_stores.get("fs::session").read()`.
   - To view shopping cart data: `faststore_sdk_stores.get("fs::session").read()`.
