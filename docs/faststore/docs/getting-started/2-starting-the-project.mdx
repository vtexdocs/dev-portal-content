title: '2. Starting a new FastStore project'
excerpt: "Create and set up your FastStore project with WebOps."
---

In this step, you'll use the [FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard) to create your FastStore project, connect it to GitHub, and deploy a live preview.  

This establishes your project’s source of truth and CI/CD path — the foundation for all later steps in this track.

## What you'll accomplish

By the end of this step, you will have:

- Created your FastStore project with basic configuration (project name, SEO tags, GTM, catalog)
- Connected your project to a GitHub repository for version control
- Set up the Headless CMS integration for content management
- Deployed your project and generated a live preview of your storefront

Your project will be accessible at `https://{accountName}.vtex.app/` and ready for local development in the next step.

## Getting to know the WebOps app

[FastStore WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard) is the **control plane** for FastStore projects. It manages every stage of your storefront’s lifecycle, from creation to deployment, and integrates with your GitHub repository and VTEX account to facilitate collaboration and automation.

    ![dashboard-overview](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/dashboard-overview.png)

WebOps connects your storefront code (GitHub) with your VTEX infrastructure, enabling a branch-based workflow for development and production. Keep the following in mind:

- **Environment requirement:** WebOps operates exclusively in the production environment. Install it only in your account’s `master` environment.
- **Development workflow:** FastStore uses a [Git branching model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) for development and testing:
  - The app is installed in the `master` environment of your VTEX account.
  - Development and testing occur on Git branches.
  - Approved changes are merged into the repository’s `main` branch and automatically deployed to production.

> ℹ️ Unlike [VTEX IO workspaces](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspace), FastStore uses a Git-based branching workflow.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Check permissions

To start a FastStore project, users must have the **Owner (Admin Super)** [role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#roles).

### Create your store catalog

Create a catalog to populate and test your store. It should include essential components such as product listing pages, search, product details, and checkout.  
Developing without a catalog may result in incomplete testing, data integration issues, and rework later.

For more information, refer to the [Catalog documentation](https://help.vtex.com/docs/tracks/catalog).

### Have a GitHub account

To complete the FastStore WebOps onboarding, you’ll need a GitHub account to host your project. You can use either a [personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github) or a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations).  
If you use a GitHub organization, ensure you have **admin access** to it.

</Steps>

## Step 1: Setting up the project

1. Open the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > FastStore WebOps**.
2. Click `Start Project`.
3. In the **Setup & Create Project** page, configure the following options for your store:

### Project

Choose the option that best fits your project's purpose. 
This helps us understand what you're trying to achieve with FastStore and improve your experience.

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title Tag**       | Enter a keyword-optimized title for your store. For example: `Buy Online with the Best Game Store - GameStore`. In this example, we used the length limit of around 50-60 characters to ensure it is fully displayed in search results without being truncated. |
| **Description Tag** | Enter a brief description of your store, for example, `Shop online at GameStore, the best game store for PC, Xbox, PS4 and Headphones. Explore our wide selection and buy your favorite games today!`                                                            |
| **Title Template**  | Enter a page title that helps search engines and users better understand the content of your store. For example, `The best game store - GameStore`.                                                                                                              |
| **Site Author**     | Enter the name of the agency or person responsible for the development of the storefront.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Catalog** | Choose which catalog your store should be linked with. |

### Terms of use

If you already have content created in the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview), be aware that it will be automatically deleted during FastStore WebOps onboarding to avoid content duplication.

To proceed, please confirm that you understand by checking the Terms of use box.

After setting up the basic configuration for your store and reviewing it, click `Continue` to proceed to the next page.

## Step 2: Setting up integrations

On this page, you will set up the native Headless CMS integration and connect to a GitHub organization.

### CMS Integration

Configure the native [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview) integration and connect to GitHub.

### Git Provider

Connect with a GitHub personal account or organization of your choice to host the source code of your FastStore project. 

    > ⚠️ If you choose to install the app in a GitHub organization, make sure you have admin access to an organization.

To connect to the FastStore WebOps app, follow these steps:

1. Click `Connect with GitHub`. A new browser tab will open on the side for you to integrate the app with GitHub.

    > ⚠️ If you are not logged in to your GitHub account, in the new tab, you will be asked to log in. Then, you can continue to the next step.

2. Once you are logged in to your GitHub account, choose the organization or your personal account you want to install the app. You will be redirected to the **Settings** page on GitHub.

    > ⚠️ Once you define the GitHub organization, you cannot change it later.

3. In **Repository access**, choose one of the following options: **All repositories from the organization** or **Only select repositories**.

4. Click `Install`.

The following successful message will appear on the page:

    ```
    Success! You can now close this page and proceed with the onboarding process.
    ```

After seeing the success message, close the browser tab and continue the onboarding process in the VTEX Admin.

5. Now that the app is integrated with GitHub, select which repository you want to start the project:

    - **New repository:** Create a repository from scratch, in this option, you only need to type a name for the repository, and after clicking `Create`, it will create the repository for you.

    - **Existing repository:** Select an existing repository from the organization to start the project.

6. Click `Create`. The deploy process will begin and, once the deployment process is complete, you will be redirected to the [Deploy Summary](#deploying-the-project) page.

## Step 3: Deploying the project

After completing the setup for your store, the deploy process will begin. This process involves creating a GitHub repository and a default domain for your project. Once the deployment process is complete, you should see the following:
