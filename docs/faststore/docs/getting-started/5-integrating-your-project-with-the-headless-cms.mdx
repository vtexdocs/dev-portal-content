In this step, you'll connect your FastStore project to [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview)  so editors can create, preview, and publish content. You'll also configure the webhooks that keep builds and previews in sync—without this integration, CMS changes won't reach your storefront.

## What you'll accomplish

By the end of this step, you will have:

- Configured Headless CMS webhooks to trigger builds when content is published
- Set up preview URLs for content editors to see changes before going live
- Configured WebOps to communicate CMS updates back to your Git repository
- Established a complete content workflow where CMS changes automatically sync with your codebase

This integration enables your content team to manage store content independently while keeping everything in sync with your development workflow.

## Step 1: Configuring the Headless CMS

Configure the URLs of the webhooks used by the Headless CMS app.

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Storefront > Headless CMS**. 
2. In the FastStore project interface, click on `Settings` (⚙️).
3. In **Settings**, click the `Build` tab.
4. In **Build Webhook URL**, click `Add`.
5. Enter the following value. _Replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario._

    ```bash
    https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.cms-builder-sf-jamstack/v1/{account}/master/build-releases
    ```

6. Click **SAVE**.
    
  > ℹ️ When an editor clicks to publish a page using the Headless CMS interface, the CMS calls the **Build Webhook URL**, which changes the page's status to `published`. The CMS then waits for the content to be built in the background.

7. Fill in the **Preview URL** field with your production URL. This URL activates the button on the Headless CMS, allowing you to preview the changes made to a page. _Replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario._

## Step 2: Communicating WebOps updates to the Headless CMS

If you are developing your FastStore project with CI/CD and Headless CMS, you must ensure that CI/CD is aware of every CMS update performed via the VTEX Admin. To do so, you must configure the WebOps webhooks responsible for communicating with the Headless CMS as follows.

1. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Edit the `discovery.config.js` file in the root directory of your project.
3. In the Headless CMS configuration, add the `webhookUrls` property corresponding to your store website as follows:

    ```js discovery.config.js
    "vtexHeadlessCms": {
      webhookUrls: [
        "https://{account}.myvtex.com/cms-releases/webhook-releases"
      ]
    }
    ```

4. Open a Pull Request in your project, including the previous changes.
5. Merge the Pull Request.

Now you can make changes to the Headless CMS and check if commits are being created in the project. In the following example, the `Hero` title was modified to `10% off on first purchase`, and we can see that it generated a commit in the repository.
