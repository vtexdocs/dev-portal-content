title: "Upgrading from FastStore v2 to v3" 
---

Stores using FastStore v2 hosted in the account's GitHub organization must upgrade to v3. In this guide, you'll learn the process for keeping your FastStore project up to date, avoiding breaking changes to your storefront.

>⚠️ For FastStore projects hosted in the `vtex-sites` organization and not using WebOps ([FastStore v1](https://v1.faststore.dev/docs)), see the guide [Migrating from FastStore v1 to v3](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-faststore-v1-to-v3) to move your project to your account's GitHub organization.

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Update the `@faststore/cli` package

1. Open your store project in the code editor of your choice.
2. Open the terminal and run `yarn upgrade @faststore/cli` to update the `@faststore/cli` package to the latest version.

### Step 2 - Rename the `faststore.config.js` file

1. In your store project, go to the `faststore.config.js` file and rename it to `discovery.config.js`.
2. Update any references pointing to `faststore.config.js` to use `discovery.config.js` instead.

### Step 3 - Sync the changes

Run `yarn dev` to sync the updates you made in the `@faststore/cli` package and the new filename.

After running the command, your project will be synchronized with the recent changes, and your FastStore v3 upgrade will be complete.
