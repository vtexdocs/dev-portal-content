title: 'Understanding the project structure'
---

In the previous guide of this track, you started your first FastStore project, learned how to run a local server, and made your first changes to the storefront. Now, it is time to understand how a FastStore project is structured.

Understanding the structure of a FastStore project can help you navigate the codebase and customize it to fit your specific needs.

Let's start taking a look at the structure that represents the source code of a FastStore project:

```
/
|-- /.faststore
|-- /src
    |-- /themes
        |-- custom-theme.scss
|-- cypress.config.ts
|-- discovery.config.js
|-- next-env.d.ts
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
|-- tsconfig.json
|-- vercel.json
|-- vtex.env
|-- yarn.lock
```

## Folders

- `/.faststore` - Manages and coordinates the FastStore project to deliver a functional starter store. This folder, also known as [@faststore/core](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson), provides the core functionality of the FastStore starter.

- `/src` - Contains all of your store's customizations, including your custom components and theme.

- [`/themes`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/themes-overview#available-themes) - Keeps your store's theme, such as [midnight](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/themes-midnight).

## Files

- `custom-theme.scss` - Holds the styling information for your store, controlling the graphic elements such as typography, colors, borders, and spacing that give your store with a unique look and feel.

- `cypress.config.ts` - Configures the options and preferences required for running tests with Cypress.

- [`discovery.config.js`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options) - Configures aspects of the project such as SEO preferences, VTEX account options, and theme. Note that these configurations are set during the [onboarding process](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview), reducing the need for changes to this file.
For more information on configuration options for this file, refer to [Configuration options for discovery.config.js](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-config-options).

- `next-env.d.ts` - Generates a TypeScript definition file for Next.js.
  
- `tsconfig.json` - Configures the compiler options and project settings for TypeScript, including target version, module resolution, and source file locations.

- `vtex.env` - Stores public environment variables that your application can access during runtime. These include flags like `SITE_HOST` (specifying the store's domain in production) and other publicly accessible values, including feature flags, URLs, and Analytics public tracking IDs. For private environment variables such as API keys and database credentials, use [VTEX secrets](https://v1.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/webops/security/setting-up-secrets).

- `yarn.lock` - Locks down the exact versions of your project's dependencies, including transitive dependencies, to ensure consistent builds across different machines and environments. This file is automatically generated based on the dependencies in your `package.json` file.

### `package.json`

Defines the project's metadata and handles dependencies and scripts using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/migration/overview). Let's take a closer look at five important packages declared in this file:

#### `@faststore/core`

Bundles FastStore source code, including the FatsStore starter: `starter store`. It contains four sub-packages, `Components`, `SDK`, `UI` and `API`, which handle the starter.

#### `@faststore/sdk`

Handles all meaningful states an ecommerce store might have, such as:

| SDK states    | Description                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session**   | Handles auth, region, locale, and currency data.                                 |
| **Cart**      |  Handles a store cart's addition, remotion, update, and current state.           |
| **Component** |  Handles the state of the components of a store (e.g., display/hide mini cart).  |
| **Search**    | Handles the state of the faceted search (e.g., apply filters and sort).          |

The SDKs also provide GA4-compatible analytics functions to help you create powerful analytics capabilities in your ecommerce.

#### `@faststore/ui`

Gathers the design system based on FastStore components, using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling. For more information, refer to the [FastStore UI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/components-index) guide.

> ℹ️ Although the components use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), you can style them using the desired tool for styling.

#### `@faststore/api`

Connects your project to your favorite ecommerce provider by creating interfaces for querying products, collections, and handling carts.

#### `@faststore/cli`

Provides scripts for building, running, debugging, and deploying your FastStore project. This package helps with debugging and differentiating between VTEX code and customizations. To learn more, refer to the [FastStore CLI documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-cli).
