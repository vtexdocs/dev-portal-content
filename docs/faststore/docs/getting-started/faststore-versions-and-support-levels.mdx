title: "FastStore versions and support levels"
---

FastStore has two main versions: FastStore v1 and FastStore v2+. This document outlines the key differences between these versions, their support levels, and guidelines for upgrading.

## FastStore v1

[FastStore v1](https://v1.faststore.dev/docs) was the first version of the framework. While it served as the foundation for FastStore, it's no longer actively maintained. New projects must use the latest version of FastStore.

## FastStore v2+

FastStore v2+ is the latest and most advanced version of the storefront solution. It encompasses all versions starting from v2 and introduces major improvements over FastStore v1, such as:

- **Simplified updates:** Stores are monitored for version updates with minimal friction, including automatic non-critical updates and a more efficient integration process.
- **Separation of VTEX-managed code and store customizations:** Clear segmentation between VTEX and custom code to help in the debug process.
- **CMS-first approach:** Headless CMS manages content updates (texts, images, links) while behavioral and UI component changes remain code-based, ensuring a structured workflow.
- **Optimized performance and quality monitoring:** Ongoing performance tracking with proactive safeguards to prevent deployments that don’t meet Lighthouse and quality standards.
- **Semantic versioning:** FastStore v2+ uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for managing releases:
  - **Majors:** Introduce breaking changes, including incompatible API updates.
  - **Minors:** Introduce backward-compatible features.
  - **Patches:** Include backward-compatible bug fixes.

## Key differences between FastStore versions

One of the main changes from FastStore v1 to FastStore v2+ is the separation between VTEX code and store-specific customizations. This separation introduced the [`core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) package for VTEX code and reserved the `/src` folder for store-specific customizations. Below are the key differences between the versions:
