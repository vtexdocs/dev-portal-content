In this final part of the Headless CMS integration, you'll promote your Content Types and Sections to production so editors can use them to create and manage content.

## What you'll accomplish

By the end of this step, you will have:

- Synced your CMS definitions to production
- Made your Content Types and Sections available to content editors in the Headless CMS app
- Completed the Headless CMS integration workflow

Your FastStore project will now be fully integrated with Headless CMS, enabling content editors to create, edit, and publish web content via the VTEX Admin.

## Instructions

If you are happy with your Content Type and Section definitions, you can promote them to production by taking the following steps:

1. Open the terminal and switch to the `master` workspace.
    ```bash
    vtex use master
    ```
2. Change to the root directory of your FastStore project and sync your changes in the `cms` folder with the Headless CMS app.
    ```bash
    faststore cms-sync
    ```

Your FastStore project is now fully integrated with the Headless CMS. Editors can create, edit, and publish web content via the VTEX Admin using the Headless CMS app.
