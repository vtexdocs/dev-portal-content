title: 'FastStore WebOps app'
---

This document provides an overview of the FastStore WebOps app, a tool designed to simplify the process of setting up a store and gives you a clear view of your website's deployments and performance. The app allows you to focus on building your storefront without the hassle of complex configurations.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Request the app's installation

Please open a ticket with the [VTEX support team](https://help.vtex.com/support) to request the installation of the FastStore WebOps app.


### Create your store Catalog

Create a Catalog for populating and testing your store with features like product listing pages, search functionality, product detail pages, and checkout. Without a Catalog, testing would be incomplete, and developing without it can cause data integration issues, delays, and extra retrofitting effort.

For more information on how to create a Catlog, refer to the [Catalog documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/3rA2tTpIoEXdv2nzC27zxR).

### Have a GitHub account 

During the FastStore WebOps onboarding, you'll need a GitHub account to install the app and create your project's repository.
The app can be installed in a [personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github) or in a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations).
