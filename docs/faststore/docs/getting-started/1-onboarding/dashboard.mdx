title: 'FastStore WebOps - Dashboard'
---

Once you have [created your FastStore project](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-starting-the-project#step-2-deploying-the-project) or are already working on customizing it, you can use the WebOps Dashboard to have an overview of your website’s deployments and performance.

The WebOps Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of website builds and deploy previews and offers suggestions on how to improve your storefront's performance based on [Lighthouse scores](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring).

To access the WebOps Dashboard, in the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > FastStore WebOps**. The Dashboard has three tabs: [Overview](#overview), [Deploys](#deploys) and [Integrations](#integrations).

## Overview

The Overview tab provides a quick snapshot of your website's key details, including the live store URL, CMS information, and latest deploy.

### Production Overview

The **Production Overview** section provides the following information about the latest deploy of your live store:

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live Store**        | URL for your production environment, accessible to shoppers.                                     |
| **Repository**        | GitHub repository associated with the project.                                                   |
| **Deploy**            | Commit for the current deployment, including the date, time, and who made it.                    |
| **CMS Provider**      | Link to [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview). |
| **CMS Project**       | Link to the FastStore project in Headless CMS.                                                   |

#### Live store ID

After onboarding with the WebOps app, you can access your store through a live store URL. To find the live store URL, access **Storefront > FastStore WebOps** in the VTEX Admin. In the [**Production Overview**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#production-overview) card, locate the **Live Store** URL.

The live store URL includes a `liveStoreId`, a unique identifier for your store. It combines your store account name and a live store ID number, for example: `https://mystore-clwjc7fw200ay9qau1smn8i4l-21vm59f3q.b.vtex.app`. Let's break down the example to understand the `liveStoreId`:

- `mystore-clwjc7fw200ay9qau1smn8i4l-21vm59f3q.b`: the `liveStoreId`.
- `mystore`: the account name.
- `clwjc7fw200ay9qau1smn8i4l-21vm59f3q.b`: the live store ID number.

> The live store ID also helps you [set up the Preview URL in the Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-1-configuring-the-vtex-account#step-2-configuring-the-headless-cms), enabling you to preview changes to your pages via the Headless CMS.

#### Live deployment statuses

This section also displays the status of the live deployment:

- **Success:** The commit was deployed to the production environment and is live.
- **Queued:** The commit is next in line to be deployed.
- **In progress:** The commit is currently being deployed.
- **Failed:** The deployment failed. Further details can be found by clicking the link below the `Deploy` button.

### Lighthouse Scores

When your store goes live (in production), ensuring optimal performance and a good user experience becomes crucial. The Lighthouse Scores section offers insights into four key areas measured by Lighthouse, helping you understand their impact on your store's performance.

- **Performance:** Indicates how fast your pages load.
- **Accessibility:** Reflects how usable your pages are for people with disabilities.
- **Best practices:** Indicates how well your pages adhere to coding best practices.
- **SEO:** Reflects how well your pages are optimized for search engines.

These scores are based on the pages defined for testing in the [Integrations](#integrations) tab.

### Production Deploys

This section lists all the recent deploys to your production store. Each item on the list is composed of the following:

![dashboard-lighthouse-score](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-production-deploys___840fcb7b30bc2c7a1e4e5d1d255a58f9.png)

### Build logs

The Dashboard includes the Build Logs section, which offers insights into your store's deployments. This feature allows you to monitor the status of each deployment and verify whether it succeeded or failed.

![webops-build-logs](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/webops-build-logs___dcab2fcebc09675e9087f3d25ca33058.gif)

To access the build logs for a specific deployment, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Production Deploys](#production-deploys) section of the WebOps page.
2. Click on a specific deployment to view its details.
3. The Build Logs will appear on the right-hand side of the screen, displaying deployment details, such as a `Preview Link` to a live preview of your store for that specific deployment.

### Preview Deploys

This section lists all the deploy previews created for GitHub branches in your project repository. These previews are automatically available for each pull request opened for a corresponding branch.

## Deploys

## Integrations

The Integrations tab allows you to configure store pages for Lighthouse Tests. Here, you can specify the URLs for a product listing page (PLP) and a product details page (PDP) to undergo automatic Lighthouse score testing during deployments. This ensures a consistent testing experience.

![dashboard-integrations](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-integrations___8575a9f0fc2abfa64bdfc10fc7534e9d.png)

### Configuring pages for Lighthouse testing

To set the pages you want to test with Lighthouse, follow these steps:

1. In the **Default Category for PLP** field, enter the [category](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-category--6HV4Q3E2FauUoOQoiCCgCg) slug defined in the Catalog.
2. In the **Default Product Slug for PDP**, enter the slug for the specific PDP you want to test.
3. Click `Save`.

Once you've set the pages for testing and after a new deploy, go to the **Overview** tab and access the **Lighthouse Scores** section to check the scores for those pages.

## Deleting the project

To delete your FastStore project, click the **More actions menu** (`⋮`). Then, click **Delete Project**.

A modal to confirm your choice will open.

> ⚠️ Proceed with caution. Deleting the project is irreversible and will permanently remove all deployments and domains associated with it.
