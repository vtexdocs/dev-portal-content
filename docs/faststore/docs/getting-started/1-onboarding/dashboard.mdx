title: 'FastStore WebOps - Dashboard'
---

Once you have [created your FastStore project](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-starting-the-project#step-2-deploying-the-project) or are already working on customizing it, you can use the WebOps Dashboard to have an overview of your website’s deployments and performance.

The WebOps Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of website builds and deploy previews and offers suggestions on how to improve your storefront's performance based on [Lighthouse scores](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring).

To access the WebOps Dashboard, in the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > FastStore WebOps**. The Dashboard has three tabs: [Overview](#overview), [Deploys](#deploys) and [Integrations](#integrations).

## Overview

The Overview tab provides a quick snapshot of your website's key details, including the live store URL, CMS information, and latest deploy.

### Production Overview

The **Production Overview** section provides the following information about the latest deploy of your live store:

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live Store**        | URL for your production environment, accessible to shoppers.                                     |
| **Repository**        | GitHub repository associated with the project.                                                   |
| **Deploy**            | Commit for the current deployment, including the date, time, and who made it.                    |
| **CMS Provider**      | Link to [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview). |
| **CMS Project**       | Link to the FastStore project in Headless CMS.                                                   |

#### Live store ID

After onboarding with the WebOps app, you can access your store through a live store URL. To find the live store URL, access **Storefront > FastStore WebOps** in the VTEX Admin. In the [**Production Overview**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#production-overview) card, locate the **Live Store** URL.

The live store URL includes a `liveStoreId`, a unique identifier for your store. It combines your store account name and a live store ID number, for example: `https://mystore-clwjc7fw200ay9qau1smn8i4l-21vm59f3q.b.vtex.app`. Let's break down the example to understand the `liveStoreId`:

- `mystore-clwjc7fw200ay9qau1smn8i4l-21vm59f3q.b`: the `liveStoreId`.
- `mystore`: the account name.
- `clwjc7fw200ay9qau1smn8i4l-21vm59f3q.b`: the live store ID number.

> The live store ID also helps you [set up the Preview URL in the Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-1-configuring-the-vtex-account#step-2-configuring-the-headless-cms), enabling you to preview changes to your pages via the Headless CMS.

#### Live deployment statuses

This section also displays the status of the live deployment:

- **Success:** The commit was deployed to the production environment and is live.
- **Queued:** The commit is next in line to be deployed.
- **In progress:** The commit is currently being deployed.
- **Failed:** The deployment failed. Further details can be found by clicking the link below the `Deploy` button.

### Lighthouse Scores

When your store goes live (in production), ensuring optimal performance and a good user experience becomes crucial. The Lighthouse Scores section offers insights into four key areas measured by Lighthouse, helping you understand their impact on your store's performance.

- **Performance:** Indicates how fast your pages load.
- **Accessibility:** Reflects how usable your pages are for people with disabilities.
- **Best practices:** Indicates how well your pages adhere to coding best practices.
- **SEO:** Reflects how well your pages are optimized for search engines.

These scores are based on the pages defined for testing in the [Integrations](#integrations) tab.

### Production Deploys

This section lists the recent deploys to your production store. Each item on the list is composed of the following:

![dashboard-lighthouse-score](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-production-deploys___840fcb7b30bc2c7a1e4e5d1d255a58f9.png)

The complete list of all store deploys and details about them, see the [Deploys](#deploys) tab.

### Preview Deploys

This section lists all the deploy previews created for GitHub branches in your project repository. These previews are automatically available for each pull request opened for a corresponding branch.

## Deploys

The **Deploys** tab provides insights into your store's deployments, including their status (success, failed, etc.). The table below summarizes the key features of the Deploys page.

![deploys-overview-page](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-deploys-ui___73666db46f823dbaf51087d163545254.png)

| 1 - Search bar | Searchs by deploy ID, commit, message, or author. |
| 2 - Pagination | Navigates through pages of deployment data. |
| 3 - Enviroment | Filters deployments by environment: <ol><li>Production: The live store where customers can interact with. </li><li>Preview: Test environment for new features, design changes, and code modifications before releasing them to production.</li></ol> |
| 4 - Branch | Filters deployments by GitHub branches. |
| 5 - Status | Filters deploy status: <ol><li>Queued: The deployment is the next in line to be executed.</li><li>In progress: The deployment is underway.</li><li>Success: The deployment has completed successfully.</li><li>Failed: The deployment process encountered an error and did not complete as expected.</li></ol> |
| 6 - Sort by | Filters deployments by **Latest first** or **Oldest First**. |
| 7 - Deployments table | Lists each store deployment with the following information: <ol><li>Score: Lighthouse score for the deployment.</li><li>Source: Commit ID and branch.</li><li>Author: Deploy author, and the date and time of the deploy.</li><li>Environment: The environment which received the changes, Production or Preview.</li><li>Deploy ID: The ID of the specific deployment.</li><li>Status: The deploy status.</li></ol>

### Deployment details

For more information, click any entry in the deploy table.

![dashboard-deploys-page-details](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-deploys-details___0bf4d690aaa118020420dd70ddd3a1b6.gif)

In the **Deploy Steps** section, select a step (e.g., **Build - Discovery**) to view build logs. These logs appear on the right and help diagnose failed deployments.

## Integrations

The **Integrations** tab allows you to configure store pages for Lighthouse Tests. Here, you can specify the URLs for a product listing page (PLP) and a product details page (PDP) to undergo automatic Lighthouse score testing during deployments. This ensures a consistent testing experience.

![dashboard-integrations](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-integrations___8575a9f0fc2abfa64bdfc10fc7534e9d.png)

### Configuring pages for Lighthouse testing

To set the pages you want to test with Lighthouse, follow these steps:

1. In the **Default Category for PLP** field, enter the [category](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-category--6HV4Q3E2FauUoOQoiCCgCg) slug defined in the Catalog.
2. In the **Default Product Slug for PDP**, enter the slug for the specific PDP you want to test.
3. Click `Save`.

Once you've set the pages for testing and after a new deploy, go to the **Overview** tab and access the **Lighthouse Scores** section to check the scores for those pages.

## Deleting the project

To delete your FastStore project, click the **More actions menu** (`⋮`). Then, click **Delete Project**.

A modal to confirm your choice will open.

> ⚠️ Proceed with caution. Deleting the project is irreversible and will permanently remove all deployments and domains associated with it.
