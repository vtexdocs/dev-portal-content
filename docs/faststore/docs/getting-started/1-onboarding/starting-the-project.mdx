#### Terms of use

If you already have content created in the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview), be aware that it will be automatically deleted during FastStore WebOps onboarding to avoid content duplication.

To proceed, please confirm that you understand by checking the Terms of use box.

After setting up the basic configuration for your store and reviewing it, click `Continue` to proceed to the next page.

### Step 2: Integrations

On this page, you will set up the native Headless CMS integration and connect to a GitHub organization.

#### CMS Integration

Choose this option to integrate with the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview), VTEX's Content Management solution.

After setting up the basic configuration for your store and reviewing it, click `Create` to proceed to the next page, [Deploy Summary](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-starting-the-project#step-2-deploying-the-project).

#### Git Provider

Connect with a GitHub personal account or organization of your choice to host the source code of your FastStore project. 

    > ⚠️ If you choose to install the app in a GitHub organization, make sure you have admin access to an organization.

To connect to the FastStore WebOps app, follow these steps:

1. Click `Connect with GitHub`. A new browser tab will open on the side for you to integrate the app with GitHub.

    > ⚠️ If you are not logged in to your GitHub account, in the new tab, you will be asked to log in. Then, you can continue to the next step.

2. Once you are logged in to your GitHub account, choose the organization or your personal account you want to install the app. You will be redirected to the **Settings** page on GitHub.

    > ⚠️ Once you define the GitHub organization, you cannot change it later.

3. In **Repository access**, choose one of the following options: **All repositories from the organization** or **Only select repositories**.

4. Click `Install`.

The following successful message will appear on the page:

    ```
    Success! You can now close this page and proceed with the onboarding process.
    ```

After seeing the success message, close the browser tab and continue the onboarding process in the VTEX Admin.

5. Now that the app is integrated with GitHub, select which repository you want to start the project:

    - **New repository:** Create a repository from scratch, in this option, you only need to type a name for the repository, and after clicking `Create`, it will create the repository for you.

    - **Existing one:** Select one existing repository from the organization to start the project.

6. Click `Create`. The deploy process will begin and, once the deployment process is complete, you will be redirected to the [Deploy Summary](#deploying-the-project) page.

### Step 3: Deploying the project

After completing the setup for your store, the deploy process will begin. This process involves creating a GitHub repository and a default domain for your project. Once the deployment process is complete, you will have one of the following scenarios:

#### Repository and live Store created

    ![success-scenario](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/deploy-summary-webops___ff30808c6eef395f89173c38880b683f.png)

In this scenario, both the repository and the live preview of the store have been successfully created. You now have the following options:
