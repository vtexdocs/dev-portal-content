title: '3. FastStore CLI'
---

The FastStore Command Line Interface (CLI) provides pre-configured scripts for starting, building, and developing FastStore projects. It also helps keep FastStore projects up to date with the [`@faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) package.

## Before you begin

To avoid errors while running the FastStore CLI `yarn faststore cms-sync` or `faststore cms-sync` commands, make sure to install the Headless CMS, its dependencies and plugins as described in the [FastStore requirements](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements).

## Running FastStore CLI on the project

The CLI is automatically added as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file, so once you run `yarn install` during the [project setup](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-2-setting-up-the-project), you can start using it in the project.

## Installing FastStore CLI globally

To use FastStore CLI commands globally on your machine, install the [`@faststore/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faststore/cli) package by following these steps:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to install `yarn` globally in your machine:

  ```bash
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

2. install the `@faststore/cli` by running the following command in the terminal:

  ```bash
  yarn global add @faststore/cli
  ```

## Default commands
Below is a brief description of the default commands available in the FastStore CLI. To view detailed information about each command, click its respective command name.

> ⚠️ Running the commands through `yarn` is already enough to develop part of your store. However, to set up your project with Headless CMS and create new sections, you need to install the FastStore CLI and use its commands.

| Command name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`build`](#build) | Generates a production-ready storefront.  It compiles the project and optimizes it for production usage. |
| [`cms-sync`](#cms-sync) | Syncs the `cms` folder of your FastStore project with [Headless CMS](). |
| [`dev`](#dev) | Starts the project in the development environment and uses `http://localhost:3000` as server by default. It allows you to change the project and see the results locally on your machine in real-time without affecting the production environment. |
| [`help`](#help) | Displays help for FastStore CLI commands. |
| [`start`](#start) | Executes the FastStore project in the root directory and uses `http://localhost:3000` as server by default. |

### `dev`

#### Usage
