Now that you have created your `cms` folder and have an overall understanding of how you'll use it, let's learn how to structure the Content Type and Section files so you can create any integrations you desire.

## What you'll accomplish

By the end of this step, you will have:

- Learned how to structure Content Types with configuration schema sets
- Understood how to define Sections with JSON Schema for editor forms
- Gained knowledge of widgets and UI schemas for rich content editing
- Developed the skills to create complex Content Types and Sections independently

This knowledge enables you to build custom content management workflows tailored to your store's needs.

## Step 1: Automatically syncing your changes

1. Before creating more complex definitions of Content Types and Sections, go to the root of your FastStore project and run `yarn dev` to enable the FastStore CLI watch mode.  Make sure to use a development workspace.
  > ℹ️ This command will monitor any changes in the project, including the new section you have created, and automatically merge it with the default sections available in [`faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview).
2. Open another terminal and run `faststore cms-sync` to automatically sync your changes in the `cms` folder with the Headless CMS app.
3. Open the **VTEX Admin**, access **Storefront > Headless CMS** and keep it next to your code to see your changes while editing the `cms` folder. Refreshing the Admin may be necessary to see your changes.

## Step 2: Adding Content Types to the Headless CMS

The `content-types.json` file is an array of JSON objects that describes the types of pages available for customization at the Headless CMS. Therefore, to create new Content Types, we need to declare a new JSON object for each of our Content Types in the `content-types.json` file. However, we still need to discover which props these objects expect. So let's get back to our previous example.

  <Tab>

    ```json filename="cms/faststore/content-types.json" copy
    [
       {
        "id": "landingPage",
        "name": "Landing Page",

          {
            "name": "Settings",
            "configurations": [

                  "widget": {
                    "ui:ObjectFieldTemplate": "GoogleSeoPreview"
                  },
                  "required": [
                    "slug",
                    "title",
                    "description"
                  ],
                  "properties": {
                    "slug": {
                      "title": "Path",
                      "type": "string",
                      "default": "/"
                    },
                    "title": {
                      "title": "Default page title",
                      "description": "Display this title when no other title is available",
                      "type": "string",
                      "default": "FastStore Starter"
                    },
                    "description": {
                      "title": "Meta tag description",
                      "type": "string",
                      "default": "A beautifully designed store"
                    },
                    "canonical": {
                      "title": "Canonical url for the page",
                      "type": "string"
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

   ```
   
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    <img src="https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/content-type-landing-page___32f4d9db9b5f4a1265ce19eeaea0fd5d.png" width="40%" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Notice that, to declare a new Content Type, you must specify at least the following three parameters:

| Key | Description |
| --- | ------------|
| `id` | The identification key of a Content Type, written in Camel Case.   |
| `name` | The name presented at the Headless CMS app.  |
| **(optional)** `configurationSchemaSets` | Creates a new tab on the page of that Content Type with advanced settings. In our example, the **Landing Page** includes a new tab called **Settings** with custom SEO settings. Check the [following section](#the-configurationschemasets-property) for more information. |

### The `configurationSchemaSets` property

Back to our example, notice that the **Landing Page** Content Type has the `configurationSchemaSets` definition. 
The `configurationSchemaSets` prop creates a new tab at the Headless CMS for that Content Type with advanced settings.

For the **Landing Page**, a custom section named **Settings**, which allows editors to change the site metadata, was created.

![Configuration Schema Sets](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/cms-settings-section___f6c8cfc11de6578e2a208ea1602ed127.png) 

Also, notice that the `configurationSchemaSets` object must contain a `name`, written in **camel case**, and `configurations`. 
In its turn, the `configurations` object must include a `name` for identification, written in camel case, and a `schema`, written in [JSON Schema v6](http://json-schema.org/) - a description language for creating forms. The `schema` defines the structure of the form used by editors to submit data.

> ℹ️ For more information on how to write a `schema`, check the [`JSON Schema Reference`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema).

After editing the `cms/content-types.json` file, remember to save your changes and check them live:
1. Access the VTEX Admin and go to **Storefront > Headless CMS**. 
2. Click on **Create New** and check the available Content Type options. 
3. Click on **Landing Page** to create a new page and check the Settings tab.

## Step 3: Adding Sections to the Headless CMS

Now, let's make some of our frontend components available for editing at the Headless CMS by writing the content schemas that represent them.

These components are referred to as **Sections**, and to create them, 
you can follow the instructions provided in the guide [Creating a new section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-creating-a-new-section). 
The guide offers detailed information on the process of creating Sections and integrating them into the Headless CMS for easy editing and management.

### The `schema` property

The `schema` will always be unique for each of your Sections as they create the form that editors will use to submit data and change the content of a given React component.

Notice that you must always declare the following properties inside the `schema` object:

| Key           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`       | The name that identifies your component in the Headless CMS app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `description` | A brief description that helps editors understand the behavior of your component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `type`        | The data type of your schema. Possible values are [`string`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html), [`object`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html), [`array`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array.html), [`number`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html#number), [`integer`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html), [`boolean`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/boolean.html). |

Depending on the `type` of your schema, you may need to define particular fields related to your component structure. For example, for a schema of the `object` type, you'll need to determine `properties` that map key-value pairs. For a schema of the `array` type, you'll need to define the `items` of that array.

> ℹ️ For more information on each property of a `schema`, check the [`JSON Schema Reference`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema).

### Using widgets

When defining your Section `schema`, you can also use the [`uiSchema`](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/docs/api-reference/uiSchema/) along with [`widgets`](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/docs/usage/widgets/) to specify which UI widget should be used to render a given field of your schema. Common widgets are `draftjs-rich-text`, `image-uploader`, and `block-select`.
Refer to the [Widgets](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-widgets) guide for more information.

{/* TODO: Check the following example of the `draftjs-rich-text` component being used. */}
