title: "Moving your FastStore project to a new GitHub repository"
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to move your FastStore project from one repository to another. This works for the following cases:

* FastStore projects hosted in the `vtex-sites` organization using WebOps that you want to move to the GitHub organization of the account.
* FastStore projects hosted in their own organization on GitHub using WebOps that you want to move to a new organization or repository.

> ⚠️ For FastStore projects hosted in the `vtex-sites` organization and not using WebOps ([FastStore v1](https://v1.faststore.dev/docs)), open a ticket with the [VTEX Support](https://supporticket.vtex.com/support) to move your project to your account's GitHub organization.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Have a FastStore project using WebOps

Make sure the FastStore project you want to move uses [WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/webops-dashboard).

### Upgrade `@faststore/cli` package

Update the `@faststore/cli` package in your project to the latest version. To do so, follow the instructions in [Updating the `@faststore/cli` package version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-updating-the-cli-package-version).

### Have a GitHub organization

Make sure you have created a GitHub organization where you want to move your project. Learn how to do so in the GitHub guide [Creating a new organization from scratch](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).

### Have a GitHub repository

Make sure you have created the GitHub repository where you want to move your FastStore project. Learn how to do so in the GitHub guide [Creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

</Steps>

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Moving your store code to the new GitHub organization

To move your store code to the new GitHub organization, follow these steps:

> ⚠️ Remember to replace the curly brackets according to your scenario.

1. Clone the **current** repository to your local environment:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{oldOrganizationName}/{oldRepositoryName}.git
    cd {oldRepositoryName}
    ```

2. Add the **new** repository to your local environment:

    ```bash
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/{newOrganizationName}/{newRepositoryName}.git
    ```

3. Verify your remote configuration:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    You should see your remote listed with the new URL.

4. Push the codebase to the new GitHub organization:

    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After completing these steps, you should see your code, files, and commit history in the new repository when you visit it on GitHub.

### Step 2 - Install the FastStore WebOps in the new GitHub organization

You already have FastStore WebOps installed in your account, but the app has not been installed in your new GitHub organization yet.

To install the FastStore WebOps in the new GitHub organization, follow the steps below:

1. Access the [FastStore WebOps installation page](https://github.com/apps/faststore-webops) on GitHub.
2. Click `Configure`.
3. Click the organization you want to move your project.
4. Specify whether WebOps should be enabled for **all repositories** in the new GitHub organization or **only selected repositories**.
4. Click `Installing & Authorizing` to install the FastStore WebOps in your new GitHub organization. You'll see the message `{"status":"pending","message":"Could not find installation intent. If you started this installation outside Faststore WebOps, follow the Faststore Cloud migration guide to finish linking your project."}`, which means the migration process is not complete yet.

### Identifying the FastStore WebOps installation ID

> ⚠️ This step is performed in the GitHub organization where you want to move your project. For example, if you're moving your FastStore project from `current-org` to `new-org`, you must follow this step in the `new-org` organization on GitHub.

To identify the installation ID of the app you set up in the previous step, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the GitHub organization settings of the account.
2. Click `GitHub Apps` under `Third-party Access`.
3. Search for **FastStore WebOps**, then click `Configure` next to the app name.
4. Check the URL to get the app installation ID. The URL follows this pattern: `https://github.com/organizations/{organizationName}/settings/installations/{installationId}`, where `{organizationName}` is the name of your organization and `{installationId}` is the app installation ID.

### Identifying the repository ID

> ⚠️ This step is performed based on the repository hosted in the **new** GitHub organization.

To identify the ID of the repository where you want to move your project, follow these instructions:

1. Access the GitHub repository page where you want to host your FastStore project. The URL follows this pattern: `https://github.com/{newOrganizationName}/{newRepositoryName}`. Replace the curly brackets according to your scenario.
2. Open the console in your browser.
3. Run the following command in the console. The response is the repository ID.

    ```javascript
    $("meta[name=octolytics-dimension-repository_id]").getAttribute('content')
    ```

### Open a ticket with VTEX Support

Open a ticket with [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) and share the following information:

* **Account:** Name of your account.
* **Link to the old repository:** URL of the repository where your project is currently hosted.
* **Link to the new repository:** URL of the repository where your want to move your project.
* **Repository ID:** The unique identifier of the repository you want to migrate. See how to get this ID in [Identify the repository ID](#identify-the-repository-id) section.
* **App installation ID (`installationId`):** The unique identifier of the FastStore WebOps installation on GitHub. See how to get this ID in [Identify the app installation ID](#identify-the-app-installation-id).

The Support team will work on your request and notify you when the process is complete.

>❗ Don't publish or make changes to the code in the new repository before the process is complete.
