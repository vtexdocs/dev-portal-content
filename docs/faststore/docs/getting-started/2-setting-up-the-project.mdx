Now that your store is up and running after [FastStore Onboarding](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview), you're ready to set up your development environment and create a unique storefront that reflects your brand. Let's get started!

In this guide, you will:

- Clone your store repository to your local machine.
- Run a local development server, usually at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
- Make your first change in your storefront.

---

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Required tooling

Before cloning your store's repository, ensure that you have the following tools on your machine:

<details>
<summary>Node.js</summary>

To run your FastStore project, you must have the latest Node.js version or a version higher than `15.0.0`.

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Yarn</summary>

We will use the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) command-line interface to add functionalities to the store and also run tasks, such as starting a development server.

<details>
<summary>Install Yarn on macOS by running the following:</summary>

```bash
brew install yarn
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install Yarn on Windows by running the following:</summary>

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

</details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Git</summary>

When developing your store's website, you will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to push your code to the cloud. You will also use Git to download and install the required files for your project.

- [Install Git on macOS using Homebrew](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- [Install Git on Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [Install Git on Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Visual Studio Code - Code Editor</summary>

When developing your store's website, you will need a code editor to write the code for your project, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (a.k.a., VS Code). Visit the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website, download and install the version appropriate to your operating system.

</details>

> ℹ️ Although you might opt to use an alternative code editor, note that [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) might help you follow along with the FastStore documentation since our documentation may include screenshots from VS Code.

### Enabling Developer Mode (Windows users)

We strongly recommend enabling Developer Mode when using the terminal for FastStore projects.
Since FastStore projects rely on creating symlinks, this mode grants the necessary permissions and privileges, reducing the chance of errors during development.
To activate Developer Mode, refer to Microsoft's official guide on [Enabling your device for development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers).

> ⚠️ Running the FastStore project as an Administrator is not recommended.

</Steps>

---

## Step 1: Cloning the store's repository

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store your project.

    > ℹ️ For Windows users, we highly recommend enabling the [Developer mode](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-2-setting-up-the-project#enabling-developer-mode-windows-users) to run the terminal.

2. Clone the repository created during the [FastStore Onboarding](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-starting-the-project#step-2-deploying-the-project) by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vtex-sites/{storeName}
    ```

    > ⚠️ Replace `{storeName}` for your store's repository.

3. Change into the working directory by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cd {storeName}
    ```

4. Install all the dependencies listed within the `package.json` file by running the following command:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

5. Open up your FastStore project in any code editor of your choice.

> ℹ️ Note that your store configuration was already set during the [FastStore Onboarding](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview). Therefore, there is no need to connect your project to your VTEX account.
  
If you want to review these configurations, you can access the `discovery.config.js` file in the root directory of your project's repository.

## Step 2: Running a local server

Let's check what the project looks like in a web browser so far.

1. Start a local development server to serve your website:

    ```bash
      yarn dev
    ```

    This may take a few minutes. Once your development server is ready, the command line will output a similar message as the following:

    ```bash
      ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
      event - compiled client and server successfully in 333 ms (951 modules)
    ```

    > ℹ️ The `dev` command is part of the [FastStore CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-cli), a pre-configured command line interface in your starter project. Using the CLI, this command enables you to execute code to keep your store's project up-to-date with the [@faststore/core package](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson).

2. Now, open your favorite web browser and navigate to the localhost served, for example, [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

    ![localhost-example](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/starter-gif___42003e72ece61064991a34c3f14e398f.gif)

While your local development server is running, you can preview any changes you make to your files and saved changes will hot reload in the browser. To stop the development server, return to the terminal and press `Ctrl + C`. To restart it, run `yarn dev` again.

## Step 3: Making the first change in your store frontend

Now that your store is up and running locally, let's make a simple change in the storefront.

Let's make the first level of customization which updates the store's [theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/themes-overview#available-themes). For this customization, we are going to use the [Soft Blue theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/themes-soft-blue).

1. Create a new file named `soft-blue.scss` in `src/themes`. This is going to be the new theme of your store.

2. Add the following styles to `src/themes/soft-blue.scss`:

    ```scss src/themes/soft-blue.scss
    // ----------------------------------------------------------
    // GLOBAL TOKENS
    // Theme Soft Blue
    // ----------------------------------------------------------

    @layer theme {
      .theme {
      // --------------------------------------------------------
      // Colors (Branding Core)
      // --------------------------------------------------------

      // PALETTE
      --fs-color-main-0: #ecf0ff;
      --fs-color-main-1: #d8e2ff;
      --fs-color-main-2: #00419e;
      --fs-color-main-3: #002c71;
      --fs-color-main-4: #001947;

      --fs-color-accent-0: #ebdcff;
      --fs-color-accent-1: #8d50fd;
      --fs-color-accent-2: #732fe2;
      --fs-color-accent-3: #5900c8;
      --fs-color-accent-4: #4700a0;

      // HIERARCHY
      --fs-color-primary-bkg: var(--fs-color-main-4);
      --fs-color-primary-bkg-active: var(--fs-color-main-2);
      --fs-color-primary-bkg-light: var(--fs-color-main-0);
      --fs-color-primary-bkg-light-active: var(--fs-color-main-1);

      // SITUATIONS
      --fs-color-success-bkg: #cee8de;
      --fs-color-warning-bkg: #f6e0ba;

      // COMPONENTS & STATES
      --fs-color-text-display: var(--fs-color-main-4);

      --fs-color-action-bkg: var(--fs-color-accent-3);
      --fs-color-action-bkg-hover: var(--fs-color-accent-2);
      --fs-color-action-bkg-active: var(--fs-color-accent-1);

      // --------------------------------------------------------
      // Typography (Branding Core)
      // --------------------------------------------------------

      // FACE
      --fs-text-face-body: 'Lato', -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;

      // --------------------------------------------------------
      // Refinements
      // --------------------------------------------------------

      // BORDERS
      --fs-border-radius: 0.25rem;

      // SHADOW
      --fs-shadow: none;
      --fs-shadow-darker: 0 0 10px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%);
      --fs-shadow-hover: 0 1px 4px rgb(0 0 0 / 10%), 0 6px 8px rgb(0 0 0 / 10%);

      // --------------------------------------------------------
      // FS UI Components
      // --------------------------------------------------------
      // Add here the customizations for FastStore UI components.

        --fs-logo-width: 8rem;

        [data-fs-product-card] {
          --fs-product-card-border-color: transparent;
          --fs-product-card-border-color-hover: var(--fs-border-color-light);

          &[data-fs-product-card-bordered='true'] {
            --fs-product-card-border-color: var(--fs-border-color-light);
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. Open the `discovery.config.js` file and change the `theme` from `custom-theme` to `soft-blue`.

    ```js discovery.config.js
      theme: 'soft-blue',
    ```

4. Restart the server and check in the browser the new theme applied to your store. You may need to refresh the page.

    ![theme-soft-blue](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/soft-blue___9eb9e3e506de6396df954598739be8f8.png)

    > ℹ️ It is important to highlight that the store's logo is set through the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview).
