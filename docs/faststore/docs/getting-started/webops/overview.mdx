This document provides an overview of the [FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard), a tool designed to simplify the process of setting up a store and give you a clear view of your website's deployments and performance. The app allows you to focus on building your storefront without the hassle of complex configurations.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Install the FastStore WebOps app

To get started, make sure you have installed the FastStore WebOps app in your store account by following the instructions in [Install the FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements#install-the-faststore-webops-app).

The FastStore WebOps app follows a specific workflow for setup and development. Keep the following in mind:

- **Environment Requirement:** The FastStore WebOps app operates exclusively in the production environment. Therefore, it must be installed only in your account's master environment.
- **Development workflow:** Unlike VTEX IO, which uses [workspaces](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspace), FastStore relies on [branching system](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) for development and testing. Here's how it works:
    1. The app is installed in the `master` environment of your account.
    2. Development and testing occur on Git branches.
    3. Once changes are approved, they are merged into your repository's production branch (by default, the repository's default branch, typically `main`) and will be available in the production environment for your customers. You can [customize which branch generates production builds](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/webops-configuring-production-and-preview-branches) in the WebOps Integrations tab.

### Create your store Catalog

Create a Catalog for populating and testing your store, featuring key components such as product listing pages, search functionality, product detail pages, and checkout. Without a Catalog, testing would be incomplete, and developing without it can lead to data integration issues, delays, and additional retrofitting effort.

For more information on how to create a Catalog, refer to the [Catalog documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/3rA2tTpIoEXdv2nzC27zxR).

### Have a GitHub account 

For FastStore WebOps onboarding, you'll need a GitHub account to set up your project. You can use either a [personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github) or a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations).
If you choose to install the app in a GitHub organization, make sure you have admin access to it.

</Steps>
