title: '1. Setting up the FastStore WebOps app'
---

This document provides an overview of the [FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard), a tool designed to simplify the process of setting up a store and give you a clear view of your website's deployments and performance. The app allows you to focus on building your storefront without the hassle of complex configurations.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Install the FastStore WebOps app

To get started, make sure you have installed the FastStore WebOps app in your store account by following the instructions in [Install the FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements#install-the-faststore-webops-app).

The FastStore WebOps app follows a specific workflow for setup and development. Keep the following in mind:

- **Environment Requirement:** The FastStore WebOps app operates exclusively in the production environment. Therefore, it must be installed only in your account's master environment.
- **Development workflow:** Unlike VTEX IO, which uses [workspaces](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspace), FastStore relies on [branching system](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) for development and testing. Here's how it works:
    1. The app is installed in the `master` environment of your account.
    2. Development and testing occur on Git branches.
    3. Once changes are approved, they are merged into your repository's `main` branch and will be available in the production environment for your customers.

### Create your store Catalog

Create a Catalog for populating and testing your store, featuring key components such as product listing pages, search functionality, product detail pages, and checkout. Without a Catalog, testing would be incomplete, and developing without it can lead to data integration issues, delays, and additional retrofitting effort.

For more information on how to create a Catalog, refer to the [Catalog documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/3rA2tTpIoEXdv2nzC27zxR).

### Have a GitHub account 

For FastStore WebOps onboarding, you'll need a GitHub account to set up your project. You can use either a [personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github) or a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations).
If you choose to install the app in a GitHub organization, make sure you have admin access to it.

</Steps>
