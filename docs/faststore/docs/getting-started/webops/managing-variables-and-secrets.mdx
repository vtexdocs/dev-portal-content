In this guide, you'll learn how to manage variables and secrets in your FastStore project using [WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-2-starting-the-project).

Variables and secrets are sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and tokens, that must be securely managed during the FastStore project deployment.

[WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-2-starting-the-project) centralizes and standardizes variable and secret management, providing a consistent and secure process across all deployment providers. This ensures that sensitive information is kept outside the project codebase and is retrieved securely by WebOps.

>ℹ️ Variables and secrets of stores that don't use WebOps are handled through the [VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-plugins) secrets plugin. To enable secret management, you need to have an empty `vtex.env` file in the project root. The key-value pairs are stored in the `secrets.revealed.json` file, which is then encrypted into `secrets.hidden.json` before being committed to the main branch. For stores using WebOps, this workflow has been deprecated, and variables and secrets are managed directly through the WebOps interface.

## Local development

For local development, you must use the `vtex.env` file to define the variables and secrets needed to run your FastStore project locally.

The `vtex.env` file is only used in local environments and should always be added to `.gitignore` to avoid leaking variables and secrets through version control. By adding it to `.gitignore`, variables and secrets defined in the `vtex.env` file won't be available in deployed environments via WebOps.

## Before you begin

VTEX has a permissions system, and only users assigned to a role with the required [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) can manage variables and secrets.

>⚠️ The permissions system is in open beta. To enable it, open a ticket with [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).

After enabling the feature, make sure you have a user associated with a role that contains the following License Manager resources:

* **Product:** FastStore
* **Category:** Secrets
* **Resources:** *View Secrets* and *Edit Secrets*

## Instructions

To manage variables and secrets, go to your [FastStore WebOps dashboard](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard) and navigate to the **Settings** tab.

![secrets-settings-webops](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/webops-settings.gif)

In the [Variables and Secrets](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#secrets) section, you can [create](#creating-variables-and-secrets), [update](#updating-variables-and-secrets), or [delete](#deleting-variables-and-secrets) variables and secrets following the steps below.

>⚠ After you create, update, or delete a variable or secret, it may take a few minutes for the change to propagate. Wait 5 minutes before triggering a new deployment.
>
> If you deployed your storefront immediately after creating, updating, or deleting a variable or secret and the change isn't reflected in your store, wait a few minutes and run another deployment before opening a support ticket.

### Creating variables and secrets

1. In the `Type` field, click `Select...` to open the dropdown menu, then choose `text` for non-sensitive values that can be viewed later (for example, public URLs), or `secret` for sensitive values that must be hidden after saving (for example, API tokens and passwords).
2. In the `Key` field, enter the name of the variable or secret, which serves as its unique identifier (for example, VTEX_API_TOKEN, NEXT_SECRET_KEY).

  >ℹ Variables accessible in the browser (client-side) must start with the prefix `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Use names without this prefix for all other variables and secrets.
 
3. In the `Value` field, enter the corresponding information you want to store (for example, the actual token, key, or password).
4. Click `Add`. A pop-up with `New secret added successfully` will open, and you'll see the message `Variables have changed. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.` alongside a `Redeploy` button.
  
  >⚠ When creating multiple variables and secrets, make sure you include all of them before proceeding to the next step. This prevents sync errors.
 
5. Wait **5 minutes**, then click `Redeploy` to redeploy your website with the updated variable and secret configuration. You'll see the message `Redeploying with secret changes`, and a pop-up with `Deployment created successfully` will open.
6. Track the deployment status in the [Deploys](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#deploys) tab of the WebOps dashboard.

During the build process, any variables and secrets added through WebOps will be transformed into environment variables within the code, which are automatically loaded into the `process.env` object. You can access these values in your code using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`. *Remember to replace `VARIABLE_NAME` with the name you assigned to your variable or secret in the `Key` field*.

The created variable or secret will be available in the **Current Keys** section.

### Updating variables and secrets

1. Go to the `Current Keys` section.
2. Next to the variable or secret you need to update, click `⋮` and then click `Edit`.
3. Click `Update`.  A pop-up with `Secret updated successfully` will open, and you'll see the message `Variables have changed. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.` alongside a `Redeploy` button.
4. Wait **5 minutes**, then click `Redeploy` to redeploy your website with the updated variable and secret configuration. You'll see the message `Redeploying with secret changes`, and a pop-up with `Deployment created successfully` will open.
5. Track the deployment status in the [Deploys](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#deploys) tab of the WebOps dashboard.

### Deleting variables and secrets

1. Go to the `Current Keys` section.
2. Next to the variable or secret you need to delete, click `⋮` and then click `Delete`.
3. Confirm the variable or secret you want to remove.

  >❗ This action can't be undone.

4. Click `Delete secret`. A pop-up with `Secret deleted successfully` will open, and you'll see the message `Variables have changed. Changes will take effect in the next successful deployment.` alongside a `Redeploy` button.
5. Wait **5 minutes**, then click `Redeploy` to redeploy your website with the updated variable and secret configuration. You'll see the message `Redeploying with secret changes`, and a pop-up with `Deployment created successfully` will open.
6. Track the deployment status in the [Deploys](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#deploys) tab of the WebOps dashboard.

  ![deleting-secrets](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/delete-secrets.gif)

>ℹ If you tried to create, update, or delete a variable or secret and got the error `Failed to create/update/delete secret. Please, try again.`, repeat the process. If the problem persists, open a ticket with [VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).
