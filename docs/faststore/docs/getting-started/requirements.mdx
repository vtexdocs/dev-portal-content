<Steps>

## Install the VTEX IO CLI on your machine

For more information, please refer to [this guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference).

## Install the Headless CMS and its dependencies

The [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview) is the content management solution for FastStore projects. During the [Onboarding](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-overview),
the integration between your project and the Headless CMS is initiated.

To prevent content duplication that could cause build failures during Onboarding, it is important to confirm the installation of the following apps in your account: 
- `vtex.admin-cms@1.x`
- `vtex.admin-cms-graphql`
- `vtex.admin-cms-graphql-rc`

To check whether you have them installed, follow the instructions below:

1. Open the terminal and log in to your account using the following command. *Remember to replace `{accountName}` with your account's name.*

    ```bash
    vtex login {accountName}
    ```

2. Run `vtex ls` to list all the installed apps in your account.
3. Check if the `vtex.admin-cms@1.x`, `vtex.admin-cms-graphql`, and `vtex.admin-cms-graphql-rc` are in the list.
If yes, proceed to check the [next requirement](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements#install-headless-cms-plugins). If not, continue following these instructions.

4. After logging into your account, install `vtex.admin-cms@1.x` by running the following command:

    ```bash
    vtex install vtex.admin-cms@1.x
    ```

    A successful message will confirm the installation:

    ![installation-message](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/cms-install___7144afabf5a895ba92905926808507b2.png)

5. Install the Headless CMS dependencies by running the following command:

    ```bash
    vtex install vtex.admin-cms-graphql vtex.admin-cms-graphql-rc
    ```

Once the app and its dependencies are installed, proceed to check the [next requirement](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements#install-headless-cms-plugins).

## Install Headless CMS plugins

To ensure you won't get errors while running Headless CMS commands in the CLI, install the Headless CMS plugins by following these steps:

1. Open the terminal and log in to your VTEX account using the VTEX IO CLI:

    > ⚠️ Remember to replace the values between curly brackets according to your account name.

    ```bash
    vtex login {account}
    ```

2. Install the Headless CMS plugin:

    ```bash
    vtex plugins install cms
    ```

Now, check if the installation of the Headless CMS plugin was successful by running `vtex cms`.

> ⚠️
>
> - **Windows user:** If you find problems while installing the plugin, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/troubleshooting-error-installing-headless-cms) article
>
> - **macOS user:** If you find problems, run `yarn config set ignore-engines true` to ignore the Node.js incompatibility version, then run `vtex plugins install cms` again.
>
> Remember, we recommend using the latest Node.js version or a version higher than `15.0.0`.

## Enable the VTEX Intelligent Search app in your account

The [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search) app enhances the user experience by providing accurate and personalized search results throughout the shopping journey.
Before developing a storefront in FastStore, you need to enable the app on your account. For more information on the Intelligent Search and its integration, please refer to the [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search) and [Integration Settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/6wKQgKmu2FT6084BJT7z5V) guides.

To enable the app, begin by checking the version of your [Edition Store](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) account.

Based on the edition version, follow the instructions below.

> ℹ️ To confirm which Edition App version is installed in your account, open the terminal and use the VTEX IO CLI. Log in to your account by running `vtex login {accountName}` and run `vtex edition get` to see the Edition App version installed on the current account.

    ```bash
    vtex install vtex.search-resolver@1.x vtex.admin-search@1.x
    ```

After successfully installing the app, integrate it by accessing the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings > Intelligent Search > Integrations**, and click on `START INTEGRATION`.

## Install the FastStore WebOps app

The [FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview) is the first step for you to create, set up and manage your FastStore project. It also provides deployment and performance insights of your website.

> ⚠️ The FastStore WebOps app only works in stores using the [Edition Store](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app#list-of-native-edition-apps). If your store is on the Edition Business, also known as using the [Legacy CMS Portal](https://help.vtex.com/es/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj) technology, make sure to [open a support ticket](https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk) to change it to the Edition Store.
Once you have changed the edition, follow the instructions on this [requirements guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-requirements#install-the-vtex-io-cli-on-your-machine).

To install the app, follow these steps.

1. In a terminal, log into your VTEX account by running the following:

    ```bash
    vtex login {accountName}
    ```

    > ⚠️ Replace `{accountName}` with your store account name, for example `vtex login store`.

2. Install the FastStore WebOps app by running the following command:

    ```bash
    vtex install vtex.webops
    ```

3. A confirmation message will appear. Type `y` to proceed.

    ```bash
    ? Are you sure you want to force this operation on the master workspace on the account store? » (y/N)
    ```
The FastStore WebOps app is now installed in your account. Refer to the [FastStore WebOps app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview) guide to create your first FastStore project.
