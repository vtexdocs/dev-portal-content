This guide will walk you through the process of filling out the bulk import spreadsheet for use with the [Bulk Import API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations) to efficiently manage Buyer Organizations, Cost Centers, and Members through bulk import functionality.

## Before you begin

To use the bulk import of buyer organizations, you must first install and configure the [B2B Suite](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.b2b-suite) which includes the [B2B Organizations](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.b2b-organizations) app.

>⚠️ Bulk Import does not allow updating (editing) existing data in organizations or cost centers. This functionality is exclusively intended for creating and managing members.

## Step-by-step

1. Download the [template file](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/PkYPXgHoDpok9ajVXQcM2/e5ff6b732ad776d2d04946855e109f15/b2b-bulk-import-template_v1.xlsx).
2. Fill in the file with buyer organizations data following the specifications detailed in [File structure for import](#file-structure-for-import).

  >ℹ Ensure your file is in `.xlsx` format and does not exceed 50MB.

3. Once your file is ready, upload it by making a request to the [Upload file](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations#post-/api/b2b/import/buyer-orgs) endpoint.
4. Validate file content by making a request to the [Validate file](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations#post-/api/b2b/import/buyer-orgs/validate/-importId-) endpoint.
5. Once the file is successfully validated, start the bulk data import by making a request to the [Start import](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations#post-/api/b2b/import/buyer-orgs/-importId-) endpoint.

## File structure for import

Before starting the upload and import process, it is essential to understand the required file structure. Ensure your import file adheres to the guidelines outlined below.
