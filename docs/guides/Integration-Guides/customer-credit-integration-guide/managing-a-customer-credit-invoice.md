Customer Credit invoice is a document automatically generated by VTEX after the customer makes a purchase using Customer Credit as a payment method and the order is billed.

In cases of installment purchases, invoices are generated according to the number of installments. For example, a purchase made with payment in 10 installments on Customer Credit will generate 10 invoices related to the same order number.

> ⚠️ The Order invoice and the Customer Credit invoice are different documents. The Order invoice is issued for all purchases made in a store, regardless of the payment method selected.
> The Customer Credit invoice is additionally issued only for purchases made using the Customer Credit payment method. Learn more about invoiced orders in [How to invoice an order](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-manually-invoice-an-order--7p1h852V5t54KyscpgxE2v).

## Updating invoice details on a Customer Credit account

Through the [Change invoice](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/customer-credit-api#put-/api/creditcontrol/accounts/-creditAccountId-/invoices/-invoiceId-) endpoint, you can update an invoice status, create an observation note, or add a link to assist your customer in the payment process.

See the example below, modifying the status, creating a observation note and adding the payment link to the invoice `7583E36F101C461094AB6CA68FA8EE2C-01` of account `111111111_CPF`:

**PUT - Change invoice**

  "paymentLink": "https://paymentlink.com"
}
```

> ⚠️ The success of this call is confirmed by the **200 OK** status and the empty response body.

To confirm the information was updated, use the [Retrieve invoice by ID](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/customer-credit-api#get-/api/creditcontrol/accounts/-creditAccountId-/invoices/-invoiceId-) endpoint.

## Postponing the due date of a Customer Credit invoice

To change the original due date of an invoice in Customer Credit, allowing the customer more time to complete the payment, you can use the endpoint [Postpone an invoice](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/customer-credit-api#put-/api/creditcontrol/accounts/-creditAccountId-/invoices/-invoiceId-/postponement).

However, before defining how many additional days of payment you will provide to the customer, you need to enable the option to postpone payment in your store's settings. To do this, you must use the endpoint [Create or change store configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/customer-credit-api#put-/api/creditcontrol/storeconfig).

The following parameters of this endpoint are responsible for enabling the option to postpone payment of invoices in the store:

- `invoicePostponementLimit`: The maximum number of times allowed to extend an invoice.
- `maxPostponementDays`: The maximum number of days an invoice can be extended.
- `postponementEnabled`: Allow extension of invoices in the store.

> ⚠️ The settings available in the [Create or change store configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/customer-credit-api#put-/api/creditcontrol/storeconfig) endpoint apply to all Customer Credit accounts registered in a VTEX store. It is not possible to customize these settings for each specific Customer Credit account of a given store.

See the example below, where a store is configured to allow invoice expiration dates to be extended up to 3 times and for a maximum period of 30 days in total.

**PUT - Create or change store configuration**

```
https://{accountName}.{environment}.com.br/api/creditcontrol/storeconfig
```

Request body example

```json
{
  "invoicePostponementLimit": 3,
  "maxPostponementDays": 30,
  "postponementEnabled": true
}
```

The response to this request provides updated information about postponing invoices and other settings already applied in the store.

Response body example

```json
{
  "dailyInterestRate": 0.01,
  "invoicePostponementLimit": 3,
  "taxRate": 0.4,
  "maxPostponementDays": 30,
  "defaultCreditValue": 150,
  "maxPreAuthorizationGrowthRate": 0.1,
  "myCreditsEnabled": true,
  "toleranceEnabled": true,
  "automaticCheckingAccountCreationEnabled": true,
  "postponementEnabled": true,
  "notificationsSettings": {
    "daysPrior": [

        "days": 1,

      }
    ],
    "daysAfter": [
      {
        "days": 0,
        "timeOfDay": "12:00:00"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> ℹ️ For more information about other configuration fields available for Customer Credit in a store, access the [Create or change store configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/customer-credit-api#put-/api/creditcontrol/storeconfig) endpoint reference.

Once invoice postponement is enabled, you can postpone a specific invoice. See the example below in which 5 additional days will be granted to pay an invoice with an original due date of May 20, 2024.

**PUT - Postpone an invoice**

```
https://{accountName}.{environment}.com.br/api/creditcontrol/accounts/11111111111_CPF/invoices/7583E36F101C461094AB6CA68FA8EE2C-01/postponement
```

Request body example

```json
{
  "dueDays": 5
}
```

> ⚠️ The success of this call is confirmed by the **200 OK** status and the empty response body.

To confirm that the new invoice due date has been modified, use the [Retrieve invoice by ID](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/customer-credit-api#get-/api/creditcontrol/accounts/-creditAccountId-/invoices/-invoiceId-) endpoint and check the updated information in the `dueDate` field.
