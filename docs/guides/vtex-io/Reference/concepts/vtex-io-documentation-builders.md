Builders play a pivotal role in streamlining app development. They are the orchestrators of VTEX IO apps, responsible for processing, validating, and passing on a specific block of code to a runtime or framework capable of executing it. This article will teach you what Builders are and how to use them effectively.

## Understanding Builders

In practical terms, a Builder acts like a bridge that allows different parts of your app to work together by configuring and connecting to the necessary services. Each Builder operates under its unique set of rules and validation processes, acting as gateways to an IO app's functionalities.

By having very well-defined and minimal responsibilities, a Builder can evolve independently, allowing for rapid development with minimal disruptive changes.

## Using Builders

Builders are specified in an app's `manifest.json` file, and the app itself is neatly structured with folders bearing the Builder's names. This organization ensures that each Builder knows precisely which code to process.

![example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/vtex-io-documentation-builders.png)

When you run a VTEX IO app, each Builder converts the files included in its corresponding folder into configurations for the competent services. This means an app can have as many Builders as you want, enabling the bundling of both frontend and backend development into a single package.

For more information on the available Builders, see the [List of Builders](#list-of-builders) section.

> To use Builders, ensure that you have at least `vtex.builder-hub@0.293.4` version [installed](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-usage#installing-an-app) in your account.

## Example

Suppose you want to develop a React frontend component with VTEX IO. For this, you will need to use a Builder that offers a React renderer, namely, the `react` Builder. To do that, you must declare the `react` Builder in your app's `manifest.json` file, as in the following:

```json
"builders": {
    "react": "3.x"
}
```

Then, in your app's root directory, you must create a folder named after the Builder (e.g., `/react`) and place your React code inside it.

When you run your app, the `react` Builder will transform the React code within the `/react` folder into compiled bundles, ready to be imported into frontend apps.

## List of Builders

This is a non-exhaustive list of VTEX IO Builders:

| `services`        | Fetches service workers exported by the account's installed apps and bundles them in a single file, enabling the store to work with several service workers simultaneously. You can learn how to use it by accessing the recipe on [Using several service workers in your store](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-several-service-workers-in-your-store).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `styles`          | Exports CSS configurations for Store Framework blocks. When building your app, the Styles Builder reads the `styles/styles.json` file and uses a [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) generator to properly produce your store's CSS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `store`           | Interprets and validates the blocks, interfaces, and routes contained in the theme app's `/store` directory, powering [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-store-framework) store's components and building the storefront.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `messages`        | Exports localized string messages, empowering _VTEX IO internationalization_.

| `paymentProvider` | Allows the implementation of payment connectors using the [Payment Provider Framework (PPF)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/payments-integration-payment-provider-framework). The framework natively provides access to the [Payment Provider Protocol (PPP) API endpoints](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/payment-provider-protocol) within predefined classes. The framework also allows the configuration of [payment methods](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455) and uses the [Secure Proxy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/payments-integration-secure-proxy) for card transactions. |
| `pixel`           | Processes the source-code and configuration of [Pixel Apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pixel-apps) in VTEX IO. The files picked up by this Builder are located in the app's `/pixel` directory.
