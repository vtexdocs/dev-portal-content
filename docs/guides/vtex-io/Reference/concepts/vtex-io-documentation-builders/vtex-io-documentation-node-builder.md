The `node` builder is used to develop [backend apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-service) with TypeScript code executed by the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org/en). This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to utilize this builder effectively. For further insights, refer to [Developing services on VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/developing-services-on-vtex-io).

## Versioning

The Node builder versions are defined in the table below. Each builder version is compatible with a specific version of the Node.js engine, [`@types/node` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node) (TypeScript definitions for Node), and TypeScript. You can select the desired builder version in your app‚Äôs `manifest.json` file.

|Builder version|Node.js|@types/node|TypeScript|Status|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|3.x|[8.x](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.0.0)|-|[3.9.7](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html)|Deprecated|
|4.x|[12.x](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.0.0)|-|[3.9.7](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html)|Deprecated|
|6.x|[16.x](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.0.0)|[12.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node/v/12.0.0)|[3.9.7](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html)|Active until June 2025|
|7.x|[20.x](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.0.0)|[20.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node/v/20.0.0)|[5.5.3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-5.html)|Active|

>‚ö†Ô∏è We strongly recommend upgrading your Node app to the latest Node builder before legacy Node builder versions are deprecated. After deprecation, apps using a legacy builder version will continue to work, but you won't be able to release or publish new **major** [versions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-releasing-a-new-app-version#understanding-app-versioning) of the app. Follow the instructions in [Node builder 7.x migration guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/node-builder-7x-migration-guide) to upgrade your Node app.

## Folder structure

An app that uses the `node` builder has a `node` folder on its root, where are located the following files and directories:

```txt
node
  ‚î£ üìÇ clients
      ‚îó üìÑ {ClientCodeFileName}.ts
  ‚î£ üìÇ middlewares
      ‚îó üìÑ {MiddlewareCodeFileName}.ts
  ‚î£ üìÇ event
      ‚îó üìÑ {EventCodeFileName}.ts
  ‚î£ üìÑ {TypeScriptCodeFileName}.ts
  ‚î£ üìÑ index.ts
  ‚î£ üìÑ package.json
  ‚î£ üìÑ service.json
  ‚îó üìÑ tsconfig.json
```

- TypeScript code files (`.ts` extension) containing the core logic of the app, organized within various directories, such as:
  - `clients`: Directory with the code files of [Clients](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients).
  - `middlewares`: Directory with the code files of middlewares.
  - `event`: Directory with the code files of event functions.
- `index.ts`: Main TyepScript code file, where the execution begins. This file contains the main class of the service.
- `package.json`: JSON file describing the dependencies, script commands for building, and version details.
- `service.json`: Service configuration file used for defining the app parameters such as routes, events, time-to-live, etc. For more details, see [Service configuration parameters](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-service#service-configuration-parameters).
- `tsconfig.json`: JSON file containing build configuration options.

## Usage

To develop an app using the `node` builder, refer to the following steps:

1. **Start with a template**: Download the [`service-example` template](https://github.com/vtex-apps/service-example) or create a new project using the [`vtex init` CLI command](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-usage#starting-a-new-project) and choose the `service-example` option.
2. **Configure the `service.json` file**: Edit the `service.json` configuration file. For more information, see [Service configuration parameters](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-service#service-configuration-parameters).
3. **Configure permissions**: If you want to access external resources, add the necessary [policies](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-policies) to get permission for each resource in the [`manifest.json`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-manifest) and the corresponding [Clients](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients) in the code to access the resources.
4. **Implement the app's logic**: Add the necessary TypeScript files containing the app logic.
5. **Testing**: [Link the app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-linking-an-app) to a development workspace for testing.

## Use case examples

Consider the following scenarios when using the `node` builder:

- **Backend service development**: If you are building backend services using Node.js, the `node` builder provides a streamlined development experience with native functions and clients for integrating with the VTEX ecosystem.
- **Event-driven applications**: For applications that rely heavily on event-driven architecture, where actions trigger responses asynchronously, the `node` builder allows developers to implement event handlers and listeners.
- **Integration with external systems**: When your application needs to integrate with external systems or APIs, such as payment gateways, databases, or third-party services, the `node` builder facilitates the development of client modules for interacting with these systems.
- **Custom middleware**: If your application requires custom middleware for tasks like authentication, logging, or request processing, the `node` builder supports the creation and integration of middleware components.

Here are some app examples that use the `node` builder:

- [orders-feed-example](https://github.com/vtex-apps/orders-feed-example)
- [external-seller-example](https://github.com/vtex-apps/external-seller-example)
- [adyen-platforms](https://github.com/vtex-apps/adyen-platforms)
- [mega-menu](https://github.com/vtex-apps/mega-menu)
