The `graphql` builder handles the GraphQL [schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) of apps, serving as an interface between frontend applications and backend [services](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-service). This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of how to utilize this builder effectively. For further information, refer to [Using GraphQL to retrieve data from Master Data](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/services-6-graphql-retrieving-data-from-master-data) and the [official GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.com/learn/what-is-graphql/).

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The `graphql` builder is used only when developing an app's GraphQL API. You don't need this builder to consume GraphQL APIs in IO apps.

## Folder structure

The `graphql` builder uses a `graphql` folder in the app‚Äôs root folder. This folder contains `.graphql` files with the schema definitions. Developers can structure the whole schema in a single file or split it into multiple files and subfolders.

For example, we recommend you to:

- Define only the endpoints ([queries](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/), [mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/mutations/), and [subscriptions](https://graphql.org/learn/subscriptions/)) in `schema.graphql`
- Handle [directives](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#directives) separately in `directives.graphql`
- Define additional types in separate files inside the `types` subfolder.

```txt

      ‚îó üìÑ b_type.graphql

‚îó üìÑ schema.graphql
```

## Usage

To develop an app using the `graphql` builder, follow the steps below:

1. **Start with a template:** Download an app template such as [`graphql-example`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/graphql-example) or create a new project using the [`vtex init CLI command`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-usage#starting-a-new-project) and choose the `graphql-example` option.
2. **Add the schema files**: Add the `.graphql` files with the schema definitions, including the endpoints (queries, mutations, and subscriptions), directives, and other types you want to define.
3. **Add the API implementation logic**: Add the code that implements and instantiates the resolver functions. See an example in [Using GraphQL to retrieve data from Master Data](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/services-6-graphql-retrieving-data-from-master-data).
    1. **Create the resolvers**: Create the resolver functions that will run when your GraphQL endpoints are called. The functions must have the same names as the endpoints defined in the schema. If you are developing a Node service, you will add the TypeScript code (`.ts` files) in the `node/resolvers` folder.
    2. **Instantiate the resolvers**: Add the code to instantiate the resolvers. If you are developing a Node service, in the `Service` class of the `node/index.ts` file, you will add a `graphql` field with the resolvers for each endpoint implemented along with the directives.
4. **Testing**: [Link the app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-linking-an-app) to a development workspace for testing. Test the endpoints with the [GraphQL IDE](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/graphql-ide).
