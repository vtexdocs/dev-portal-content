According to your operating system, follow the respective steps to install VTEX IO CLI on your computer.

## MacOS

- **Brew**

> ⚠️ For computers running on an Apple M series chip (M1, M2, etc.), before installing VTEX IO CLI, install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861). This enables your computer to use the command-line interface for a Mac with an Intel processor. To install Rosetta, run the following in your terminal: `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`.

  1. Install Xcode by running the following command:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

  2. Install **Homebrew** by following the instructions on the [**Homebrew website**](https://brew.sh/index).

  1. Install **VTEX IO CLI** by running the following command:

```sh
brew tap vtex/vtex
brew install vtex
```

## Linux

- **Tarball**

  > ⚠️ Before the installation, check if you have the [curl](https://curl.se/) command-line tool and library installed on your computer.

  Open the terminal and run the following command to install VTEX IO CLI.

```sh
curl -L https://vtex.io/vtexcli/install | sh
```

## Windows

- **Installer for Windows**

  1. Download the appropriate installer for your Windows system ([64-bit installer](https://vtex.io/vtexcli/install/win-x64); [32-bit installer](https://vtex.io/vtexcli/install/win-x32)).
  2. Open the downloaded file and follow the instructions to complete the installation process.
  3. Run the Windows Terminal with admin permission by right-clicking the Windows Terminal icon and selecting `Run as administrator`.
  4. Run the following command to complete the installation:

```sh
vtex
```

   After completing these steps, you'll see the following message:

> ℹ️ Further usage of VTEX IO CLI doesn't require admin permission.

## Installing CLI via NPM

Since VTEX IO CLI is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), you can install it manually via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vtex). This method is recommended only for environments where auto-updating VTEX IO CLI is not ideal.

> ❗️ We highly recommend using an alternative installation method. If you choose to install VTEX IO CLI via npm, remember that CLI won't update automatically, and the Node version on your computer might conflict with the one used by CLI developers. If you opt for any other installation method, VTEX IO CLI will always be up-to-date, preventing installation issues.
