After developing your store with [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) and [going live](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-go-live), you may need to make some updates, such as adding new features to your [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) and extending your store features to enhance the shopping experience or improve ecommerce management.

In this section, you will find recommendations to help you update your live store successfully.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Develop your Store Theme

Make sure your store has a [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) developed with [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) and [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework), following the [Getting started](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/getting-started-3) tutorial.

### Check the builders

Check if the builders are properly installed in your Store Theme. To use builders, your account must have at least version `vtex.builder-hub@0.293.4` installed. Also, you need to specify them in the app's `manifest.json` file. Learn more in [Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders).

### Customize your theme

Customize your store theme based on your business needs, following the guides within the [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) section, such as [Building pages](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-building-pages) and [Using components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-using-components).

### Go live

After developing your store with [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) and customizing it based on your business needs, follow the instructions in [Going live with a new store](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-go-live) to make your ecommerce available to shoppers.
