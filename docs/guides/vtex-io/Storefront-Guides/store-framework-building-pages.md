Store Framework streamlines page creation by offering a set of pre-built components and [development tools](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/developer-experience#developer-tools). These resources simplify building and customizing different page types, such as product details pages, promotional layouts, and custom pages.

This section covers a range of page-building scenarios, and each guide focuses on practical implementation, ensuring you can effectively develop pages that meet your business needs.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Develop your Store Theme

Make sure your store has a [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) developed following the [Getting Started](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/getting-started-3) tutorial.

### Check the builders

Check if the builders are properly installed in your Store Theme. To use builders, your account must have at least version `vtex.builder-hub@0.293.4` installed. Also, you need to specify them in the app's `manifest.json` file. Learn more in [Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders).

Make sure the [store builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-builder) is configured, as it enables the development of Store Framework storefronts.

### Learn about VTEX IO apps

Familiarize yourself with [VTEX IO apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-io-apps).

</Steps>

## Essential concepts

To better understand how to build your store pages, you should understand the concepts of **components** and **templates**.

Components are building blocks created using the [VTEX IO development platform](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) and [React](https://react.dev/) technology, which are used to create storefronts and admin apps.

Learn more in the [Components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-using-components) guide.

A template refers to the structural layout of your site pages. Templates define the components for various pages, such as the home, product, and search results pages, by declaring `json` blocks that render these components.

Learn more in the [Configuring templates](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-4-configuringtemplates) guide.
