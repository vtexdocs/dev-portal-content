This guide explains how to configure and enable custom 404 error pages in stores using [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework).

A 404 error is an HTTP response code that indicates the server can't find the requested page. This often occurs when a user tries to access a page that has been removed or no longer exists, such as a deactivated product page.

For ecommerce businesses, enabling 404 pages is essential to
prevent search engines like Google from indexing non-existent pages, which may negatively impact [SEO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/storefront-seo).
and improve user experience by guiding visitors to valid content.

In Store Framework, 404 pages are enabled by default for non-existent product pages and URLs with more than one invalid segment. You can also configure 404 pages for URLs with a single invalid segment, as outlined in the [instructions](#instructions) below.

> âš  The native 404 functionality doesn't apply to URLs generated by user searches. These URLs include the `map=ft` parameter and are not considered non-existent. In rare cases where search URLs include the `map=specificationFilter` parameter without `map=ft`, 404 pages might be displayed.

## Instructions

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps > Extensions Hub> App Management**.
2. Search for the **Rewriter** app and click the **Settings** button.
3. Select the checkbox to **Enable 404 for paths with one segment, such as `/foo`**. This setting ensures that 404 pages are shown for URLs with a single invalid segment.
4. Click `Save`.
