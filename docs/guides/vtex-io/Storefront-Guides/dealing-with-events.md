Events are actions or notifications that trigger specific responses. They provide insights into customer behavior and allow you to create dynamic shopping experiences.

Events can be triggered by user actions in the storefront (e.g., adding an item to the cart) or automatically generated by a system. On VTEX, every event is broadcast to the cloud, where [VTEX IO apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-io-apps) can capture and respond to them accordingly. Responses can range from behind-the-scenes actions, such as sending a confirmation email, to visible changes in the storefront, such as displaying a promotional popup or updating the cart.

Moreover, events integrate with analytics tools and third-party apps. Tracking events, such as page views, product impressions, or cart updates, provides metrics on customer behavior, helping businesses make data-driven decisions and optimize store performance. Learn more in the [Analytics](LINK) guide.

In this section, you will learn how to handle your store events.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Develop your Store Theme

Ensure your store has a [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) developed following the [Storefront](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/getting-started-3) guide.

### Check the builders

Check if the builders are properly installed in your Store Theme. To use builders, you must have at least the `vtex.builder-hub@0.293.4` version installed in your account. Also, you need to specify them in the app's `manifest.json` file. Learn more in [Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders).

Make sure the [store builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-builder) is configured, as it enables the development of Store Framework storefronts.

### Customize your storefront

Customize your store theme based on your business needs by following the guides within the [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) section, such as the guides [Building pages](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/building-pages) and [Using components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/using-components).

### Learn about VTEX IO apps

Familiarize yourself with [VTEX IO apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-io-apps), including how to build custom solutions, such as [Pixel apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-1-developnativeintegrationswithpixelapps) and [Service](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-service).
