To allow component customization in [Site Editor](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/site-editor-overview--299Dbeb9mFczUTyNQ9xPe1?&utm_source=autocomplete), you need to define the schema for each editable property and reference these definitions in the `interfaces.json` file.

In this guide, you will learn how to configure the schema definitions in your components, allowing users to customize them directly in the Site Editor.
Follow the steps below to configure the schema definitions for your custom components.

## Before you begin

Ensure your store has a [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) developed with [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) and [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework), according to the [Storefront](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/getting-started-3) guide.

Check if the [Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders) are properly installed in your Store Theme. You must have at least the following builders configured:

- [store builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-builder): Enables the development of Store Framework storefronts.
- [react builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-react-builder): Used to develop apps with [React](https://react.dev/) when your project requires customized frontend solutions. 

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Defining your custom component

For your block to accept user customizations, export the React component responsible for the block. This component should include a schema that allows editing directly in the Site Editor.

1. Create a new folder in the `/react` root directory. Follow the pattern `react/components/{ComponentName}/index.tsx`. For example, for a component named `CustomComponent`, the folder structure is as follows:

```txt
react
 ‚î£ üìÇ components
      ‚î£ üìÇ CustomComponent
           ‚î£ index.tsx
```

<CH.Scrollycoding>

2. Open the `index.tsx` file and define your custom component. Let‚Äôs break down the code into parts:

---

**Interface definition:** The `CustomComponentProps` defines the type for the component‚Äôs props, specifying `title` and `subtitle` as the expected string props.

<CH.Code show={["react/CustomComponent/index.tsx"]}>

```tsx react/CustomComponent/index.tsx 
import React from 'react';

interface CustomComponentProps {
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
}
```

</CH.Code>

---

**Component definition:** The functional component `CustomComponent` takes an object with `title` and `subtitle` props as its argument, allowing easy access to these props.

<CH.Code show={[]}>

```tsx
const CustomComponent = ({ title, subtitle }: CustomComponentProps) => {
   return (
      <>
         <p>{title}</p>
         <p>{subtitle}</p>
      </>
   );
};
```

</CH.Code>

---

**Default props:** The `defaultProps` specifies the default values for the props of the `CustomComponent`. If the user does not define props in the Site Editor, the `defaultProps` values will be returned.

<CH.Code show={["react/CustomComponent/index.tsx"]}>	
```tsx
CustomComponent.defaultProps = {
  title: "VTEX",
  subtitle: "The Composable and Complete Commerce Platform.",
};
```

</CH.Code>

---

**Schema definition:** The `schema` defines the structure and types of the props, allowing the component to be customized within the Site Editor.

<CH.Code show={["react/CustomComponent/index.tsx"]}>

```tsx
CustomComponent.schema = {
  title: 'Custom Component',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    title: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'T√≠tulo',
    },
    subtitle: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'Subt√≠tulo',
    },
  },
};
```

</CH.Code>

---

**Export the component:** Export the component, making it available. By setting `CustomComponent` as the default export, you can import it into other app parts.

<CH.Code show={["react/CustomComponent/index.tsx"]}>

```tsx
export default CustomComponent;
```

</CH.Code>

</CH.Scrollycoding>

>‚ÑπÔ∏è Ensure you define the `defaultProps` and `schema` objects for the component in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format, a declarative language that provides a standardized way to describe and validate JSON data.

### Step 2 - Exporting the custom component

For better organization and management, especially for apps with many custom components, it is recommended to create separate folders for each component within `react/components` and then export them from individual files in the `/react` root directory.

In the `/react` root directory, create a new file to export your component:

```tsx react/CustomComponent.tsx
import CustomComponent from './components/CustomComponent';

export default CustomComponent;
```

### Step 3 - Referencing definitions within the `interfaces` file

Now, you need to reference your custom component in the [`interfaces.json` file](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-interface) within the `/store` folder. This file establishes the relationship between a block and a React component, allowing the [store builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-builder) to build the store's frontend.

Follow the steps below to declare your definitions in the `interfaces.json` file:

1. In the app's repository where you are developing your custom component, open the `interfaces.json` file within the `/store` folder.

   ```txt
   store
    ‚î£ üìÑ interfaces.json
   ```

2. Declare the schema definitions for your component as follows:

   ```json store/interfaces.json
   {
     "custom-component": {
       "component": "CustomComponent",
       }
   }
   ```

>‚ÑπÔ∏è In the schema above, the block identifier is named `custom-component`. Choose a name that clearly describes the component it references.

### Step 4 - Using the component within a store page

To use the new component, declare it within the desired page template. For example, to use the `CustomComponent` on the store‚Äôs main page, the `custom-component` block must be declared within the `home` block:

```json
{
   "store.home": {
       "blocks": ["custom-component"]
   }
}
```

By [linking the app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-linking-an-app), your component will be available to visualize and test in the Site Editor within the corresponding [development workspace](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-development-workspace).

### Step 5 - Making your component available in the live store‚Äôs Site Editor

After configuring and testing your component, deploy the new version of your app to make it available in the live store‚Äôs Site Editor.

Learn how to make it available in the [Deploying a new app version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-making-your-new-app-version-publicly-available) guide.

When the process is finished, the component will appear as follows in the live account‚Äôs Site Editor:
