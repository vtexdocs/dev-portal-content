To allow component customization in [Site Editor](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-site-editor), you need to define the schema for each editable property and reference these definitions in the `interfaces.json` file.

In this guide, you will learn how to configure the schema definitions in your components, allowing users to customize them directly in Site Editor.

## Before you begin

- Ensure your store has a [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) developed with [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) and [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework), following the [Storefront](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/getting-started-3) guide.
- Check if the [Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders) are properly installed in your Store Theme. You must have at least the following builders configured:
   - [Store builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-builder): Enables the development of Store Framework storefronts.
   - [React builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-react-builder): Used to develop apps with [React](https://react.dev/) when your project requires customized frontend solutions. 

## Instructions

<CH.Scrollycoding>

### Step 1 - Creating the files for your custom component

For your block to accept user customizations, export the React component responsible for the block. This component should include a schema that allows editing directly in Site Editor.

1. Create a new folder in the `/react` root directory. Follow the `react/components/{ComponentName}/index.tsx` pattern. For example, for a component named `CustomComponent`, the folder structure is as follows:
   
2. Open the `index.tsx` file and define your custom component.

```txt
  react
     ┣ 📂 components
        ┣ 📂 CustomComponent
           ┣ index.tsx
```

---

### Step 2 - Defining the component interface
  
The `CustomComponentProps` defines the type for the component’s props, specifying `title` and `subtitle` as the expected string props.

```tsx react/CustomComponent/index.tsx focus=1:6
import React from 'react';

interface CustomComponentProps {
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
}

const CustomComponent = ({ title, subtitle }: CustomComponentProps) => {
   return (
      <>
         <p>{title}</p>
         <p>{subtitle}</p>
      </>
   );
};

CustomComponent.defaultProps = {
  title: "VTEX",
  subtitle: "The Composable and Complete Commerce Platform.",
};

CustomComponent.schema = {
  title: 'Custom Component',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    title: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'Título',
    },
    subtitle: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'Subtítulo',
    },
  },
};

export default CustomComponent;
```

---

### Step 3 - Declaring the component
  
The functional component `CustomComponent` takes an object with `title` and `subtitle` props as its argument, allowing easy access to these props.

```tsx react/CustomComponent/index.tsx focus=8:15
```

---

### Step 4 - Defining the component props
  
The `defaultProps` specifies the default values for the props of the `CustomComponent`. If the user does not define props in Site Editor, the `defaultProps` values are returned.

```tsx react/CustomComponent/index.tsx focus=17:20
```

---

### Step 5 - Configuring the Site Editor schema

The `schema` defines the structure and types of the props, allowing the component to be customized in Site Editor.

>ℹ️ Ensure you define the `defaultProps` and `schema` objects for the component in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format, a declarative language that provides a standardized way to describe and validate JSON data.

```tsx react/CustomComponent/index.tsx focus=22:35
```

---

### Step 6 - Exporting the component

By setting `CustomComponent` as the default export, you can import it into other parts of the app or other apps. For better organization and management, especially for apps with many custom components, we recommend creating separate folders for each component within `react/components` and then exporting them from individual files in the `/react` root directory.

In the `/react` root directory, create a new file to export your component:

<CH.Code>
```tsx react/CustomComponent/index.tsx focus=37
```

---

```tsx react/CustomComponent.tsx
import CustomComponent from './components/CustomComponent';

export default CustomComponent;
```

</CH.Code>

---

### Step 7 - Updating the `interfaces.json` file

Now, you need to reference your custom component in the [`interfaces.json` file](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-interface) within the `/store` folder. This file establishes the relationship between a block and a React component, allowing the [store builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-builder) to build the store's frontend.

In the app repository where you are developing your custom component, open the `interfaces.json` file within the `/store` folder. Declare the schema definitions for your component as follows:

```json store/interfaces.json
{
"custom-component": {
   "component": "CustomComponent",
   }
}
```

>ℹ️ In this schema, the block identifier is named `custom-component`. Choose a name that clearly describes the component it references.

---

### Step 8 - Using the component in a store page

To use the new component, declare it in the desired page template. For example, to use the `CustomComponent` on the store’s main page, the `custom-component` block must be declared within the `home` block:

```json
{
"store.home": {
   "blocks": ["custom-component"]
}
}
```

By [linking the app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-linking-an-app), your component will be available for visualization and test in Site Editor within the corresponding [development workspace](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-development-workspace).

---

### Step 9 - Making your component available in the live store’s Site Editor

After configuring and testing your component, deploy the new version of your app to make it available in the live store’s Site Editor.

Learn how to make it available in the [Deploying a new app version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-making-your-new-app-version-publicly-available) guide.
When the process is finished, the component will appear as follows in the live account’s Site Editor:
