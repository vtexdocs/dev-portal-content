---

In this guide, you will learn how to override the blocks provided by a native VTEX IO app with a custom app by configuring the `store/plugins.json` file. This approach allows custom apps to modify existing Store Framework blocks without directly modifying the original app's code. 

This is especially useful when you need to customize a page or component while maintaining compatibility with future updates of the original app. Follow the steps below to ensure that your custom app will work properly with existing dependencies and block schemas.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Develop your VTEX IO custom app

Start the development of a new VTEX IO app by running the `vtex init` command and choosing the appropriate template. Learn more in the tutorial [Storefront apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-1-developing-storefront-apps-using-react-and-vtex-io).

### Check the builders

Configure the following builders in the app's `manifest.json` file:
  - [`store builder`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-builder): Enables the development of Store Framework storefronts.
  - [`react builder`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-react-builder): Used to develop apps with [React](https://react.dev/) when your project requires customized frontend solutions.

</Steps>

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Managing dependencies

Add the corresponding native VTEX IO app as a dependency in the custom app's `manifest.json` file.

```json manifest.json/dependencies
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.original-app": "1.x"
  }
```

### Step 2 - Defining the app's schema

1. Inside your app's root directory, create the `store` folder.
2. In the `store` folder, create the `interfaces.json` file and define the app's schema by following the original. For example, if the native app block has `example-child` as `required`, the new block must also declare it:

  ```json
  "new-block": {
   "component": "NewBlock"
   "required": ['example-child']
  }
  ```

### Step 3 - Configuring plugins

In the `store` folder, create the `plugins.json` file within the key-value pairs of the blocks you want to override.

  ```json store/plugins.json
  {
    "original-block": "new-block"
  }
  ```

### Step 4 - Customizing your app code

Declare the React component for your new block. In the example below, we added the greeting **HELLO WORLD**.

```js NewBlock.js
import React from 'react'

const NewBlock: React.FC = () => {
  return <h1>HELLO WORLD</h1>
}

export default NewBlock
```
