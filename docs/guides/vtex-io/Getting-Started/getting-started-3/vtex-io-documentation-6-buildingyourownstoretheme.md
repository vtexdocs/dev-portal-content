After completing the initial setup, creating your Store Theme project, and learning how to customize your store pages, you can start implementing advanced personalization for your store.

Under the [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) category, you'll find a set of guides to help you customize your storefront:

- [Building pages](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-building-pages): Create different types of pages tailored to your business needs.
- [Using components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-using-components): Build your storefront, from basic elements to advanced customizations, by leveraging VTEX IO Store Framework components.
- [Using advanced layouts](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-using-advanced-layouts): Create advanced layouts in your Store Framework store.
- [Working with Site Editor](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-working-with-site-editor): Customize your Store Framework storefront by using Site Editor.
- [Styling](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-styling): Customize your store layout with Store Framework.

You can also access our [hands-on course on the VTEX Store Framework](https://learn.vtex.com/page/learning-path-lang-en).

> â„¹ To foster constructive collaboration among developers, facilitate version monitoring, and improve the visibility of your Store Theme app, use code versioning tools such as GitHub. Learn more in [Best practices on workspace management](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspaces-best-practices).

Once you've finished customizing your storefront, whether by completing the hands-on course or following our guides, remember that your Store Theme app is still stored locally on your computer and linked to your VTEX store only through the development workspace. To make your changes visible to end users, you need to [make your theme content public](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-making-your-theme-content-public).
