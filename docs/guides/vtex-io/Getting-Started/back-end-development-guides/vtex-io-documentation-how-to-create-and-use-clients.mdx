If you need to integrate your VTEX IO app with external services that aren't covered by [VTEX IO's native Clients](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients), creating custom Clients can be a powerful solution. Custom Clients extend the functionality of VTEX IO Client types, offering benefits like caching and versioning. This guide will walk you through the process of creating custom Clients for your VTEX IO apps.

> ⚠️ Note that direct communication with APIs is generally discouraged in favor of implementing a dedicated Client. By creating custom Clients, you can extend the capabilities of your VTEX IO applications, enabling seamless integration with a wide range of services.

The diagram below illustrates how an app works with a Client to an external service:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor OA as Requester / event
  participant A1 as IO app
  participant ES as External<br/>service
  OA->>A1: Request to IO app /<br/> event listened by IO app
  A1->>ES: Request with <br/> custom Client
  ES-->>A1: Response of <br/> external service
  A1-->>OA: [If requester] <br/> Response of IO app
```

As you develop your custom Client, you will define methods within it. These Client methods are functions responsible for handling the logic needed to execute specific actions. They facilitate interactions with services and APIs, managing requests and responses effectively.

Once you've created your custom Client, you can seamlessly integrate it into your VTEX IO app to execute the implemented methods. While you have the flexibility to incorporate data-handling logic within your Client's methods (e.g., field mapping or data filtering), it's essential to keep the core responsibilities of the Client well-organized.

## Before you begin

Before diving into Client development, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **VTEX IO development workspace:** Ensure you have a VTEX IO development workspace set up. For more information, refer to [Creating a Development workspace](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-development-workspace).
- **TypeScript Familiarity:** This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of TypeScript, as we'll be using the `node` [Builder](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders) to develop with TypeScript. For more information, refer to [TypeScript's official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).
- **Understanding of Clients:** Clients play a crucial role in facilitating interactions between your application and both external and internal services. For more information, refer to [Clients](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients).

## Instructions

In this guide, we will create a custom Client example for communicating with GitHub APIs. We'll implement the following methods within our Client:

- `getRepo`: Fetches a GitHub repository given the owner and repository name.
- `getUser`: Retrieves GitHub user data based on a specified GitHub username.
- `createTag`: Creates a new tag on GitHub, taking into account the repository owner, repository, and tag data.
- `searchRepos`: Searches for GitHub repositories using a specified query.

### Step 1 - Setting up your VTEX IO app

1. Start a new VTEX IO app using the `node` builder and open the project using your preferred code editor.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `node` folder of your project.

    ```shell
    cd node
    ```

3. Install the `@vtex/api` and `@octokit/rest` packages by running the following command:

    ```shell
    yarn add @vtex/api @octokit/rest
    ```

4. Open the app's `manifest.json` file and add the necessary [Policies](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-policies). Policies are a set of permissions granted to an app, allowing or forbidding it to execute a given set of actions, such as making requests to an external resource. For this example, we will use the `outbound-access` policy to communicate with GitHub APIs (`api.github.com`).

    ```json manifest.json
    "policies": [
      {
        "name": "outbound-access",
        "attrs": {
          "host": "api.github.com",
          "path": "*"
        }
      },
    ]
    ```

    > ⚠️ Note that incorrect policies may result in request blocking.

### Step 2 - Creating a custom Client

1. Create a folder named `clients` inside the `node` directory.
2. Create a TypeScript file for your Client in the `node/clients` directory. Choose a name that easily identifies your Client (e.g., `github.ts`).
3. Implement the TypeScript class that extends the appropriate [Client type](#client-types) from `@vtex/api`. In this example, we will create the `GithubClient`. Also, since we are communicating with GitHub's external APIs, we will use `ExternalClient`.
4. Use [`InstanceOptions`](#instanceoptions) as needed, configuring options such as authentication, timeout, caching, and more based on your requirements.

```ts node/clients/github.ts
import type { IOContext, InstanceOptions } from '@vtex/api'
import { ExternalClient } from '@vtex/api'

export default class GithubClient extends ExternalClient {
  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super('http://api.github.com', context, {
    ...options,
    retries: 2,
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json',
      'x-vtex-use-https': 'true'
    }
    });
  }

  // Add the Client-related methods here
}
```

Ensure to export the Client from its module, either [default or named export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export).

### Step 3 - Implementing Client methods

Within your Client TypeScript file, implement the methods for your Client. You can leverage the methods provided by the [HttpClient](#httpclient-methods) to build your own methods. For example:

```ts node/clients/github.ts
import type { RestEndpointMethodTypes } from '@octokit/rest'

...

  public getRepo({ owner, repo }: GitRepo, token?: string) {
    return this.http.get<RestEndpointMethodTypes['repos']['get']['response']>(
      this.routes.repo({ owner, repo }),
      {
        metric: 'git-repo-get',
        headers: {
          Accept: 'application/vnd.github.nebula-preview+json',
          ...(token && { Authorization: `token ${token}` }),
        },
      }
    )
  }
```

Below we have the complete code example:

<CH.Code>
```ts node/github.ts focus=1:2
import type { IOContext, InstanceOptions } from '@vtex/api'
import { ExternalClient } from '@vtex/api'
import type { RestEndpointMethodTypes } from '@octokit/rest'

interface GitRepo {
  owner: string
  repo: string
}

export default class GithubClient extends ExternalClient {
  private routes = {
    repo: ({ owner, repo }: GitRepo) => `/repos/${owner}/${repo}`,
    user: ({ username }: { username: string }) => `/users/${username}`,
    tags: ({ owner, repo }: GitRepo) => `/repos/${owner}/${repo}/git/tags`,
    searchRepos: () => '/search/repositories',
  }

  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super('http://api.github.com', context, {
      ...options,
      retries: 2,
      headers: {
        Accept: 'application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json',
        'x-vtex-use-https': 'true',
      },
    })
  }

  public getRepo({ owner, repo }: GitRepo, token?: string) {
    return this.http.get<RestEndpointMethodTypes['repos']['get']['response']>(
      this.routes.repo({ owner, repo }),
      {
        metric: 'git-repo-get',
        headers: {
          Accept: 'application/vnd.github.nebula-preview+json',
          ...(token && { Authorization: `token ${token}` }),
        },
      }
    )
  }

  public async getUser({ username }: { username: string }) {
    const response = await this.http.getRaw<
      RestEndpointMethodTypes['users']['getByUsername']['response']
    >(this.routes.user({ username }), { metric: 'git-user-get' })

    return response.data
  }

  public createTag(
    {
      owner,
      repo,
      ...tagData
    }: {
      owner: string
      repo: string
    } & RestEndpointMethodTypes['git']['createTag']['parameters'],
    token?: string
  ) {
    console.info('Tag data:', tagData)

    return this.http.post<RestEndpointMethodTypes['git']['createTag']>(
      this.routes.tags({ owner, repo }),
      tagData,
      {
        metric: 'git-create-tag',
        headers: { ...(token && { Authorization: `token ${token}` }) },
      }
    )
  }

  public searchRepos({ query }: { query: string }) {
    return this.http.get<
      RestEndpointMethodTypes['search']['repos']['response']
    >(this.routes.searchRepos(), {
      metric: 'git-search-repos',
      params: { q: query },
    })
  }
}
```
</CH.Code>

VTEX API core types:

- `IOContext`: Contains the VTEX IO context data, such as account, workspace, locale, authentication token, etc.
- [`InstanceOptions`](#instanceoptions): The options for configuring your `HttpClient` instance.
- `ExternalClient`: The base Client class for communicating with external APIs.

---

Type of the base Client that the custom Client extends from. Used to connect with external APIs.

```ts node/github.ts focus=10:10 mark=10:10[43:56]
```

---

A variable to store a map of routes for each method implemented in the Client. This structure is not mandatory, but it makes the code more readable when calling the `HttpClient` methods.

```ts node/github.ts focus=11:16
```

---

The `baseUrl` argument in `super` must be a URL starting with `http://`. For a secure connection, set the header `''x-vtex-use-https'` to `'true'`. This header changes the request to HTTPS when the request to the external service leaves the VTEX infrastructure.

```ts node/github.ts focus=19,24
```

---

Configuration options to each request of this Client. It extends `AxiosRequestConfig` adding some IO-specific options. In this example, we are setting the number of retries and the `Accept` header to indicate the desired format to receive, and the `x-vtex-use-https` header to force the use of HTTP instead of HTTPS.

```ts node/github.ts focus=21:25
```

---

The `metric` parameter gives a name to identify each HTTP call for analytics purposes.

```ts node/github.ts focus=33
```

---

The `getRaw` method retrieves additional information about the response, such as headers. The `get` method retrieves only the response body.

```ts node/github.ts focus=43:45 mark=43[38:43]
```

---

The query parameters are passed using this format, resulting in `?q={{query}}` being appended to the request's URL.

```ts node/github.ts focus=78
```

### Step 4 - Exporting custom clients

Now that you've created your custom Client, you need to organize and export it for use in your VTEX IO service. Follow these steps:

1. Create an `index.ts` file in the `node/clients` folder.
2. Inside the `index.ts` file, import the custom Client you created in the previous step. For example:

    ```ts
    import GithubClient from "./github.ts";
    ```

3. Define a class called `Clients` that extends `IOClients`. This class is used to organize and configure your custom Clients. Within the Clients class, declare a `get` property for each of your custom Clients. This property allows you to access a specific Client by name. In our example, we've created a Client named `github` that uses the `GithubClient` class.

    ```ts
    import { IOClients } from "@vtex/api";
    import GithubClient from "./github.ts";

    export class Clients extends IOClients {
      public get github() {
        return this.getOrSet("github", GithubClient);
      }
    }
    ```

Now that you have developed and exported your custom Client to communicate with the desired service, your Clients can be accessed and used within your VTEX IO service to perform various tasks, such as interacting with external APIs like GitHub. Learn how to use Clients effectively in the [Using Node Clients](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/using-node-clients) guide.

## Client types

The [`@vtex/api`](https://github.com/vtex/node-vtex-api/) package provides a structured way to create Clients.

| Type               | Use case                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AppClient`        | Communication with other IO Services via HTTP calls.             |
| `AppGraphQLClient` | Communication with other IO GraphQL services.                    |
| `ExternalClient`   | Communication with external APIs.                                |
| `JanusClient`      | Communication with VTEX Core Commerce APIs through Janus Router. |
| `InfraClient`      | Communication with VTEX IO Infra services.                       |

Refer to the diagram below to better understand the relationship between Client types.
