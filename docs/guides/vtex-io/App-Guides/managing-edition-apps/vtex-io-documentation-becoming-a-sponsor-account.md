To become a [Sponsor Account](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-sponsor-account) and be able to manage apps and configurations across multiple accounts with [Edition Apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app), you must first check if your account meets the conditions described in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

If your account is qualified to become a Sponsor Account, follow the [Instructions](#instructions) section to activate this feature for your account.

## Before you begin

To be eligible to become a Sponsor Account, ensure you have the following:

- Access to three or more accounts related to the same group or holding.
- An Edition App published by `vtex` installed on your account (`vtex.edition-business@0.x` or `vtex.edition-store@2.x`).

  > ℹ️ You can check the Edition App installed on your account by running `vtex edition get` in your terminal. If you see the following error: `Message: Edition not set`, [open a support ticket](https://help.vtex.com/support) requesting the installation of either `vtex.edition-business@0.x` or `vtex.edition-store@2.x`. See [Edition App](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) for more information.

## Instructions

If your account meets the prerequisites described in the previous section, take the following steps to become a Sponsor Account.

1. [Open a ticket](https://help.vtex.com/support) with the VTEX Support team, expressing your desire to become a Sponsor Account and develop your own Edition Apps. Remember to include the following information in your ticket:
    - The name of the main account.
    - The names of the accounts that the main account will sponsor.

    The VTEX team will evaluate your request and take the necessary steps to enable your main account to sponsor other accounts.
2. Once you receive a successful reply to your support ticket, you must [create, deploy, and release your Edition App](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-configuring-an-edition-app).
3. [Open a new ticket](https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk) with the VTEX Support team, requesting the installation of your new Edition App for the desired accounts.

Once you receive a successful reply to your support ticket, you'll be able to sponsor child accounts using the account you used to develop and release your new Edition App.
