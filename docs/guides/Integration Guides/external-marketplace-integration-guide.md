In our native multi-seller architecture, VTEX stores decouple different aspects of an e-commerce operation in order to clearly divide responsibilities between marketplace and seller.
![VTEX Seller and VTEX Marketplace](https://files.readme.io/4e90638-VTEX_Seller_and_VTEX_Marketplace.png)
This allows VTEX stores to become marketplaces themselves or become sellers in other VTEX stores without requiring any additional development. Store settings connect the marketplace subsystem of a store to the seller subsystem of another.

This behavior can be leveraged in endless combinations. VTEX accounts can both set up a marketplace storefront to sell products from multiple sellers, including their own, and distribute products to multiple other marketplaces. This creates our [collaborative commerce](https://vtex.com/en/blog/strategy/collaborative-commerce-imperative-why-digital-first-collaboration-is-at-the-core-of-todays-business-success/) network.

However, there may be a strategic partner for your business operating outside our collaborative commerce network. This guide presents the steps needed to develop a **custom connector to sell your products in an external marketplace**.
