The [Interactive Marchitecture tool](https://assets.vtex.com/4524045/) allows you to simulate the store architecture interactively by choosing which services and add-ons will be used, along with third-party providers for integrations.

When you open the [Interactive Marchitecture tool](https://assets.vtex.com/4524045/), you first have to choose the desired region to plan the store architecture. The region selection defines the available partners for third-party integrations.

With the tool open, you can access all the services, add-ons, and integrations described in the [VTEX Composable Components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-composable-components) guide. You can identify each component type by its color:

- Services: Hot pink boxes.
- Add-ons: Light pink boxes.
- Integrations: Dark blue boxes.
- Platform interaction tools: Light blue boxes.

You can enable and disable services, add-ons, User Admin functionalities, and Developer Tooling by clicking on them. If you click twice on an add-on, it opens a pop-up with a video explaining that add-on.

When you click on one type of integration, e.g., carriers, it opens a pop-up with the available partners for that type of integration and the selected region and you can choose up to four partners. Then, you can click on the X in the top-right corner to close the pop-up.
