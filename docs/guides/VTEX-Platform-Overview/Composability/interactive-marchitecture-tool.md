excerpt: "Learn how to use the Interactive Marchitecture tool and simulate a composable VTEX store architecture."
---

The [Interactive Marchitecture tool](https://vtex.com/en-us/assets/interactive-architecture/) allows you to simulate the store architecture interactively by choosing which services and add-ons will be used, along with third-party providers for integrations. For reference, see types of architectures for specific scenarios in our [Store architecture](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-architecture) guide.

When you open the [Interactive Marchitecture tool](https://vtex.com/en-us/assets/interactive-architecture/), you first have to choose the desired region to plan the store architecture. The region selection defines the available partners for third-party integrations.

The tool displays all the services, add-ons, and integrations described in the [VTEX Composable Components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-composable-components) guide. You can identify each component type by its color:

- Services: Hot pink boxes.
- Add-ons: Light pink boxes.
- Integrations: Dark blue boxes.
- Platform interaction tools: Light blue boxes.

You can enable and disable services, add-ons, User Admin features, and Developer Tooling by clicking them. If you double-click an add-on, a pop-up opens with a video explaining it.

When you click a type of integration, e.g., Carriers, a pop-up opens with the available partners for that type of integration and the selected region. You can choose up to four partners. Then, you can click the X in the top-right corner to close the pop-up.

After selecting all the desired options for your store planning, you should have something like the image below.
