excerpt: "Learn about the components VTEX offers to build a composable store."
---

Various components are available in a VTEX store to fulfill the multiple types of digital commerce businesses. This guide details each platform component and explains their composable features.

![Composable architecture](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/docs/guides/VTEX-Platform-Overview/Composability/composable-architecture.png)

In the tables below, each component is classified by type.

- **Built-in** type means that the component comes installed out-of-the-box with the VTEX store.
- **Plug-and-play** type means that the component does not come installed, but it can be installed with a few steps and, after configuration in some cases, it will be ready to use.
- If a component is neither **Built-in** nor **Plug-and-play**, it may require a more complex configuration or a development stage.

> ℹ️ The specific set of components used in a store will vary based on each scenario and business model. See the [Store architecture](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-architecture) guide for more details about store implementation in specific scenarios.

If you want to try composability and simulate building a store architecture, see the details in the [Interactive Marchitecture tool](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/interactive-marchitecture-tool) guide.

## Commerce Platform

Merchants can sell through multiple channels, including their website, physical stores, Sales App, and more. This strategy allows all data (order processing, payment transactions, etc.) to be shared between channels and accessible from the Admin.

For instance, the customer could place an order online and have the option to pick up specific items in a physical store, or they could make a purchase in a physical store and have it delivered to their address.<br><br>

## Platform interaction

Merchants can interact with a VTEX store in two ways: VTEX Admin and Developer Tooling. Learn more about their components in the following sections.

### VTEX Admin

The VTEX Admin is a panel for managing the entire digital commerce experience in one place. The [Admin](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-admin-start-here--531cHtUCUi3puRXNDmKziw) provides a complete out-of-the-box feature set, including pages with dashboards, settings, and detailed information from our [core modules](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/75MX4aorniD0BYAB8Nwbo7). In the Admin, merchants can manage catalog, prices, and inventory, add payment options, and view transactions, order status, customer data, sales performance, among others. Adding new features to the store through the Admin is also possible via the Extensions Hub.

### Developer Tooling

Various tools are available for creating new features on the VTEX platform. Development can be done by the merchant’s tech team or by [partner agencies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl#implementation-partners). VTEX offers many possibilities for building new features, including apps and storefront features using [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io), custom behaviors with data in [Master Data](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/master-data--4otjBnR27u4WUIciQsmkAw), and [integrations](#integrations) using our [APIs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference), which extend VTEX’s out-of-the-box features.

## Integrations

Integrations allow external providers to integrate their solutions with VTEX stores by leveraging [VTEX APIs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference). Many integrations are readily available from our partner ecosystem. Merchants just need to install and configure them before use. You can also develop new integrations by following our integration guides or request this service from our [partners](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl#implementation-partners).

For more information about how integrations work, see our [Backend integrations overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/7euXDZR5CCnVFSrXyczIhu) and the **Integration Guides** section in our [Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides).

    <td>ERP</td>
    <td>ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is the main back office software that manages essential parts of the operation related to Catalog, Pricing, Logistics, and Orders.<br><br>
      Some parts of the operation that an ERP deals with can be delegated to other software types: A <b>WMS</b> can manage Logistics, a <b>PIM</b> can manage Catalog, and a <b>CPQ</b> can manage Pricing. See the details about integration with these software types in the table below.<br><br>
      An ERP system integrates with VTEX to exchange data and give commands. These integrations are implemented using the APIs from each module (<a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api">Catalog</a>, <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/pricing-api">Pricing</a>, <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/logistics-api">Logistics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api">Orders</a>). The integration is done in two phases, an initial setup for importing product-related data and a middleware setup for configuring order processing.<br><br>
      Merchants can choose which ERP system to use with VTEX and which parts of their operation to integrate. Some ERPs on the market already have an integration implemented with VTEX, so merchants only need to configure through the UI. Otherwise, the integration must be developed by the merchant technical team or an <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl#implementation-partners">implementation partner</a>.<br><br>

    <td>OMS/WMS</td>
    <td>
      OMS (Order Management System) is a tool designed to handle order processing. VTEX has its own OMS but merchants can integrate external software, usually an ERP system, with the <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api">Orders API</a> to receive order events and handle order processing. There are two types of order integrations for receiving order events:
      <ul>
        <li>Feed: The external software reads a queue of order events.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Hook: The external software receives automatic notifications about order updates.</li>
      </ul>
      After receiving an event, the external software handles the order with various possible actions, such as changing, canceling, invoicing, and tracking an order during handling, and then returns the result to VTEX’s OMS. <br><br>
      For details about implementing integrations with our OMS, see <b>Middleware configuration</b>, <b>Order integration</b>, and <b>Order Processing</b> in our <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/7euXDZR5CCnVFSrXyczIhu">Backend integrations overview</a>, <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/orders-feed">Feed v3</a>, <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/erp-integration-set-up-order-integration">Set up order integration</a>, and <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/erp-integration-set-up-order-processing">Setup order processing</a> guides.<br><br>
      WMS (Warehouse Management System) is a back office software responsible for managing the operation’s inventory and logistics. On VTEX, integrations with this software send inventory data (warehouses and SKU quantities). For more details, see <b>Inventory</b> in our <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/7euXDZR5CCnVFSrXyczIhu#inventory">Backend integrations overview</a>, and our <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/erp-integration-import-inventory">Import inventory</a> guide.
