The VTEX Sales App allows the use of an **Observation** field, where you can store additional information regarding the order.

The information entered in this field is sent via API to the Order Management System. They populate the `openTextField` field, which can be retrieved later either in the Admin or through an [Orders API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api) call.

>ℹ️ To activate the Observation field on the order screen, open a [support ticket to VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) requesting this feature.
