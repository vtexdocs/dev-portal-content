To accurately track campaign performance and apply the appropriate billing model — whether based on clicks (CPC), impressions (CPM), or conversions (CPA) — you must notify VTEX Ads whenever a relevant ad event occurs.

The following event types are required for effective reporting:

- **Impressions**: When an ad is rendered on the screen.
- **View**: When a banner ad is visibly seen by the user (banner ads only).
- **Clicks**: When a user clicks on an ad.
- **Conversions**: When a user completes a defined conversion action after interacting with an ad.
