To activate your VTEX Ads integration, the first step is to synchronize your product catalog. This ensures that product and inventory data is available for campaign creation and conversion tracking.

Catalog data is essential for:

- Enabling advertisers to select products for **Product Ads** campaigns.
- Supporting conversion attribution for both **Product Ads** and **Banner Ads**.

Catalog synchronization is divided into two stages:

1. [Product information](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/synchronizing-product-information)

   Send relevant product attributes such as name, image, brand, and price to VTEX Ads so they can be accurately represented in ads and used for targeting and reporting.

2. [Inventory information](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/synchronizing-inventory-information)

   Keep stock levels updated to ensure ads are only shown for available products and campaigns reflect real-time inventory.
