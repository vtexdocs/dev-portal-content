The **VTEX Ads API** serves as the central point of integration between VTEX Ads and the retailer's platform, enabling the display of advertisements to consumers.

Built using REST architecture, this API allows your platform to:

- Synchronize the product catalog with VTEX Ads to ensure up-to-date product and inventory data.
- Request ads to be displayed on your ecommerce, marketplace, or app.
- Send event notifications such as impressions, views, clicks, and conversions to help track ad performance and attribute results.

Currently, VTEX Ads supports two ad formats:

- **Sponsored Products (Product Ads)**: Ads that highlight individual SKUs, typically shown in search or category pages.
- **Banner Display (Banner Ads)**: Visual ads that promote brands or campaigns in designated areas of your site.
