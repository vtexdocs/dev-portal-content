Conversion tracking is crucial for measuring ad campaign effectiveness in VTEX Ads. This guide explains how to properly send conversion events when users complete purchases after interacting with your advertisements.

## Conversion event rules

- Conversion events should be sent when an order is closed.
- Each conversion requires both `user_id` and `session_id` for proper attribution.
- Events must include complete order information including items and customer details, as detailed in `POST` [Track conversions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/vtex-ads-api#post-/v1/beacon/conversion).
- Prices must be sent per unit. Don't multiply the `price` or `promotional_price` by the `quantity`.
- All customer identifiers (email, phone, etc.) must be hashed for privacy.

> üöß Don't construct event URLs manually. Always use the URL provided from the `POST` [Get ads](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/vtex-ads-api#post-/v1/rma/-publisher_id-) request.
>
> This is extremely important to ensure long-term stability of the integration, because the parameters of the event URL may change over time, but the integration itself does not.

## Sending a conversion event

Use the `POST` [Track conversions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/vtex-ads-api#post-/v1/beacon/conversion) endpoint to send conversion events. Check the endpoint documentation for detailed information about all available fields.

Request example:

```json
