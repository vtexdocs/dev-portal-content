Impression tracking is fundamental for measuring ad visibility in VTEX Ads. This guide explains how to properly send impression events when your application displays advertisements to users.

## Impression event rules

- Impression events should be sent when an ad is rendered in the viewport.
- Each impression is deduplicated within a 1-minute window per user, per device, per ad.
- Impression events require both `user_id` and `session_id` for proper attribution.
- Impression URLs are unique to each ad and should be obtained from the [Get ads](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/vtex-ads-api#post-/v1/rma/-publisher_id-) response.

> üöß Don't construct event URLs manually. Always use the URL provided from the `POST` [Get ads](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/vtex-ads-api#post-/v1/rma/-publisher_id-) request.
>
> This is extremely important to ensure long-term stability of the integration, because the parameters of the event URL may change over time, but the integration itself does not.

## Sending an impression event

Use the `POST` [Track ad impressions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/vtex-ads-api#post-/v1/beacon/impression/-ad_id-) endpoint to send impression events. Check the endpoint documentation for detailed information about all available fields.

Request example:

```json
POST https://events.newtail-media.newtail.com.br/v1/beacon/impression/4a94bc6e-7db1-425f-8430-cb4d17488b3b?pos=1 HTTP/1.1
accept: application/json
content-type: application/json

{
  "user_id": "6f92d1e9-00b6-4f8b-9645-faeab321e1cc",
  "session_id": "5898b8d1-c250-4bb5-931b-8b9d0ee7b499"
}
```

Successful response example:

>‚ÑπÔ∏è A successful response will have HTTP code 202.

```json
{
 "messages": [
  "impression will be processed soon"
 ]
}
```

Failed response example:

>‚ÑπÔ∏è A failed response will have HTTP code 422. The error message follows the [RFC 8927](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8927/) format

```json
[
  {
    "instancePath": "",
    "keyword": "required",
    "message": "must have required property 'user_id'",
    "params": { "missingProperty": "user_id" },
    "schemaPath": "#/anyOf/0/required"
  },
  {
    "instancePath": "",
    "keyword": "required",
    "message": "must have required property 'session_id'",
    "params": { "missingProperty": "session_id" },
    "schemaPath": "#/anyOf/1/required"

  {
    "instancePath": "",
    "keyword": "anyOf",
    "message": "must match a schema in anyOf",
