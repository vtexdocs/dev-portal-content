In this step-by-step, we teach you how to overwrite an automatic message translation from the Catalog, such as a product name or a product description, with a more specific and representative content of your store.

As a background, catalog messages are translatable text strings related to the catalog of a store, saved as external data in the [Catalog API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#overview).

> ℹ️ The Catalog API is responsible for manipulating a store’s sales channels, categories, brands, products, SKUs, and specifications.

The following list contains the settings from the Catalog API that are internally set as translatable. Meaning that, given a locale, an automatic translation fetched from the *automatic translation service* is available.

- **Category:** name, keywords (similar words), page title (tag title), meta tag description, and the URL slug (cross-border stores only).
- **Brand:** name, keywords (similar words), page title (tag title), meta tag description, and the URL slug (cross-border stores only).
- **Product:** name, keywords (substitute words), page title (tag title), description, short description, meta tag description, and the URL slug (cross-border stores only).
- **SKU** name.
- **[SKU or product specification](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/2NQoBv8m4Yz3oQaLgDRagP):** name, description, and values.
- **[Category group](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-category-groups--tutorials_246)** name.

However, we understand that considering literal translations and cultural factors, you may want to overwrite automatic translations with specific and representative content of your store.

This is possible via the `catalog-graphql` app, which is the GraphQL interface of the Catalog API.

## Step by step

Follow this step by step if you aim to translate text messages from your store's catalog.

1. [Install](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app) the `vtex.admin-graphql-ide@3.x` app using your terminal.

2. Access the **GraphQL admin IDE** section of the desired account. You will find it in the admin's side-bar menu:

<img style="box-shadow: 0 3px 9px 0 rgba(61, 62, 64, 0.2);" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/images/catalog-internationalization-1.png"/>

3. From the dropdown list, choose the `vtex.catalog-graphql` app.
4. Click on  *Query Variables* at the bottom of the page.
5. According to your scenario, check the following sections ([category](#category), [brand](#brand), [product](#product), [SKU](#SKU), [SKU or product specification](#SKU-or-product-specification), [specification values](#specification-values)) for orientations on how to fill in the main text box and the *Query Variables* section.
6. After adjusting your query, click on the play button to run the declared mutation. The expected response is a boolean value indicating `true`.

Now, no further actions are needed on your part. Once you receive the expected response, you are ready to check out the desired changes in your store!

## Category

### Mutation

Fill in the main text box with the following mutation command:

```gql
mutation translate($args:CategoryInputTranslation, $locale:Locale){
  translateCategory(category:$args,locale:$locale)
}
```

### Query Variables

According to the following example and the following explanations, fill in the *Query Variables* section with the desired translations of each parameter.

```json
{
  "args":{
    "id": "3",
    "name": "Elêtronicos",
    "title": "Casa - Eletrônicos",
    "description": "Esta é a descrição da categoria Eletrônicos",
    "keywords": [
        "eletronicos",
        "utensílios"
    ],
    "linkId": "eletronicos"
  },
  "locale": "pt-BR" 
}
```

- `id`: the category ID. Every category in your store has a unique ID that can be found under *Catalog* > *Categories* in the admin.
- `name`: category name.
- `title`: category page meta title.
- `description`: detailed description about the category.
- `keywords`: an object containing the translations of **each** substitute word of the category.
- `linkId`: the `textLink` (unless your store is a cross-border one, it must **not** be translated).
- `locale`: target translation locale.

> ℹ️ If your store is a cross-border one, keep in mind that the `linkId` is the slug used to build the category URL. Hence, an alias with the translated URL slug of this category will be automatically created in the [Rewriter](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/rewriter) app for the binding associated to the target locale. The alias is stored in the `resolveAs` field of its related internal route in the Rewriter app. For example: a category registered under the `eletronics` slug as in `http://{storename}.com/us/eletronics/d`, could have its slug translated to `eletronicos` for the `pt-BR` binding, as in `http://{storename}.com/br/eletronicos/d`.

## Brand

### Mutation

Fill in the main text box with the following mutation command:

```gql

    "siteTitle": "Calvin Klein",
    "keywords": "calvin klain"
  },
  "locale": "pt-BR" 
}
```

- `id`: the brand ID. Every brand in your store has a unique ID that can be found under *Catalog* > *Brands* in the admin.
- `name`: brand name.
- `text`: brand description (meta tag description).

- `locale`: target translation locale.

> ℹ️ If your store is a cross-border one, keep in mind that the `linkId` is the slug used to build the product URL. Hence, an alias with the translated URL slug of this product will be automatically created in the [Rewriter](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/rewriter) app for the binding associated to the target locale. The alias is stored in the `resolveAs` field of its related internal route in the Rewriter app. For example: a product registered under the `blue-top-retro-camera` slug as in `http://{storename}.com/us/blue-top-retro-camera/p`, could have its slug translated to `camera-retro-azul` for the `pt-BR` binding, as in `http://{storename}.com/br/camera-retro-azul/p`.
