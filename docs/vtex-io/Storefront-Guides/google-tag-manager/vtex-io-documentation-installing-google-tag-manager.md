> ⚠️ This app is only available for stores built with [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-store-framework). For stores built with Legacy CMS Portal, refer to [Configuring Google Tag Manager](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-setup-google-analytics-in-vtex-store--G2P0rmSrEiqCcmUMyUUwG#configuring-google-tag-manager).

This guide provides a step-by-step guide on installing and configuring Google Tag Manager (GTM) on Store Framework stores. The guide also highlights some restrictions to avoid performance issues and unpredictable behavior, including blocklists for custom HTML tags and variables.

> ⚠️ If you have already installed the Google Tag Manager app, navigate to this guide's section titled [Create a Google Analytics 4 property](#create-a-google-analytics-4-property) to create the property and follow along.

## Before you start

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you match the following requisites:

### Access to a Google account

You need a Google account to use Google Tag Manager (GTM). If you already use Google products like Gmail, you can use the same account.

If you do not have an account for a Google product, create one by following Google's guide on [Creating your Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?service=analytics&continue=https%3A%2F%2Ftagmanager.google.com%2F&dsh=S1158101756%3A1642078409369040&biz=true&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp&nogm=true).

### Access to a GTM Container

To use a GTM ID in your store, you'll need a GTM container. If you don't have one already, follow the steps in the [create a new account and container tutorial](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en#install).

Once you've created a container, you can find its GTM ID in the `Container ID` column. Be sure to take note of this ID, as you'll need it later during the installation process.

### Create a Google Analytics 4 property

Create a Google Analytics 4 (GA4) property using the GA4 Setup Assistant. This property collects data in parallel with your existing Universal Analytics (UA) property. To create the GA4 property, follow [Google’s official guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9744165#zippy=%2Cin-this-article).

### Take note of GTM settings

Take note of the Measurement ID, also known as [*G- ID*](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9539598#find-G-ID), since it will be used later to set up the GA4 tag on GTM.

## Step by step

1. Access your VTEX **Admin** and go to **Account settings > Apps > App Store**.

2. Search for the Google Tag Manager app and click `Install`. You will be redirected to the [App Store page](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-google-tag-manager/p). Log in to your App Store account if you are not currently logged in.

3. Then, you will be redirected to the [App Store landing page](https://apps.vtex.com/). In the search field, type `Google Tag Manager`, click the app, and then click `GET APP`.

4. On the checkout page, click *check the Google Tag Manager terms and conditions*, and if you agree, click `PLACE ORDER`.

> ℹ️ GTM is a free app.

5. You’ll see a success message about the purchase. Click `GO TO INSTALL PAGE`, which will redirect you to the GTM setup page.
6. You'll see a warning message prompting you to complete the necessary settings. Type your **GTM ID** in the Google Tag Manager field.
7. Click Save.

> ℹ️ To find your store's **GTM ID**, first, you need a container for the Google Tag Manager account. If you do not have one, follow the [create a new account and container tutorial](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en#install) and, then, get the GTM ID from the `Container ID` column of the container.

8. In the VTEX Admin, access **Apps > My apps**, check the box **Send Google Analytics 4 Events**, and click `Save`.

Once you have installed the app and check the box **Send Google Analytics 4 Events**, see the [Configuring Google Analytics 4 Configuration tag in Google Tag Manager](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-setting-up-google-tag-manager) documentation and learn how to set up the variables, triggers, and tags necessary for the app to work.

## Restrictions

To avoid performance problems and unpredictable behavior, the VTEX IO Google Tag Manager solution uses the native GTM blacklist feature. You can read more about this feature in the [Google Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/web/restrict). By default, the HTML ID is blocked, automatically blocking all the tags, variables, and triggers of type `customScripts`.

The main consequence of this blacklist is that custom HTML tags will not be triggered. **The HTML blacklist is the VTEX Google Tag Manager app default.** If you want to disable this restriction, go to `https://{accountName}.myvtex.com/admin/apps/vtex.google-tag-manager@3.x/setup` and check the toggle below.

![restrictions](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/vtex-io-documentation-installing-google-tag-manager-1.png)

Most widely used custom HTML tags are integrations with third-party services, like Customer Chat, Analytics, Remarketing, and Pixel tags. If your store needs custom HTML for any of those cases, the integration can either be done by transforming the tags in a [VTEX IO Pixel app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pixel-apps) or by removing this restriction. See below the full list of tags and variables that are blocked by default in the VTEX IO Google Tag Manager solution:

**Blocked tags**

- Custom HTML Tag - html
- Eulerian Analytics Tag - ela
- SaleCycle JavaScript Tag - scjs
- Upsellit Global Footer Tag - uslt
- Upsellit Confirmation Tag - uspt

**Blocked variables**

- Custom JavaScript Variable - jsm

See a list with all the available GTM tags on [the Google Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/web/datalayer).
