This Repo contains the custom apps that was develop to can reuse in differents projectst. The correct usage of this apps is duplicate the necessary apps in another project with the same name of accout as its vendor name.  If you use all apps you cand duplicate all repository.

## Configuration 


1. Create a new repo or duplicated repo if you need all custom apps
2. In new repo, by convention, saves its vendor in `manifest.json` file like `"vendor":"ACCOUNT-NAME"` and its name like `"name":"components"` 
4. Duplicate components code from this repository
5. Create at the React folder first level a .tsx file that have like name the classname of component
6. Import and export by default the class name
7. Create the interface in the store folder to export the component

## Currents availables custom Apps
- container-layout
- card-layout
- highlight-content
- responsive-image
- pum

Remember to add a table with all blocks exported by the app and their descriptions. You can verify an example of it on the [Search Result documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.search-result@3.56.1/). 

Next, add the **props table** containing your block's props. 

If the app exports more than one block, create several tables - one for each block. For example:

### `block-1` props

| Prop name    | Type            | Description    | Default value                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
| `XXXXX`      | `XXXXXX`       | XXXXXXXX         | `XXXXXX`        |


### `block-2` props

| Prop name    | Type            | Description    | Default value                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
| `XXXXX`      | `XXXXXX`       | XXXXXXXX         | `XXXXXX`        |

Prop types are: 

- `string` 
- `enum` 
- `number` 
- `boolean` 
- `object` 
- `array` 

When documenting a prop whose type is `object` or `array` another prop table will be needed. You can create it following the example below:

- `propName` object:

| Prop name    | Type            | Description    | Default value                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
| `XXXXX`      | `XXXXXX`       | XXXXXXXX         | `XXXXXX`        |


Remember to also use this Configuration section to  **showcase any necessary disclaimer** related to the app and its blocks, such as the different behavior it may display during its configuration. 

## Modus Operandi *(not mandatory)*

There are scenarios in which an app can behave differently in a store, according to how it was added to the catalog, for example. It's crucial to go through these **behavioral changes** in this section, allowing users to fully understand the **practical application** of the app in their store.

If you feel compelled to give further details about the app, such as it's **relationship with the VTEX admin**, don't hesitate to use this section. 

## Customization

The first thing that should be present in this section is the sentence below, showing users the recipe pertaining to CSS customization in apps:

`In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style/using-css-handles-for-store-customization).`

Thereafter, you should add a single column table with the available CSS handles for the app, like the one below. Note that the Handles must be ordered alphabetically.

| CSS Handles |
| ----------- | 
| `XXXXX` | 
| `XXXXX` | 
| `XXXXX` | 
| `XXXXX` | 
| `XXXXX` |


If there are none, add the following sentence instead:

`No CSS Handles are available yet for the app customization.`
