This is a minimal VTEX IO theme to help you integrate your **[FastStore project](faststore.dev)** with VTEX solutions still powered by VTEX IO and Store Framework, such as OrderPlaced and MyAccount.

After installing this theme in a VTEX account, you will have:

- A minimal header consisting of a logo with a link associated with it.
- A MyAccount page.
- A Login page.
- An OrderPlaced page.
- A minimal footer consisting of VTEX's logo and a "Powered By" tagline.

To learn more about how to integrate your FastStore store with VTEX functionalities, [check out our docs](https://faststore.dev/how-to-guides/platform-integration/vtex).
