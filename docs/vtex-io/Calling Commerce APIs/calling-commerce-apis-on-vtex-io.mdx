When developing a VTEX IO app, one of the possible needs is to access VTEX Core Services (Catalog, OMS, Logistics, etc.), which can be done using our APIs. In this course, you will understand some basic concepts about **VTEX Commerce APIs** and how to use them in your application running on VTEX IO.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand how authentication works for VTEX apps and use it to access external resources.
- Use Clients in an app to make requests and access VTEX Core Services.

You can check following documentation on our Developer Portal, which explains with more details some concepts used through this course:

- [Clients](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients)
- [Policies](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-policies)
