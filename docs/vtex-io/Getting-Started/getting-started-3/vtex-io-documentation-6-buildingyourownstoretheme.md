Throughout this track, you understood what *workspace*, *VTEX IO CLI*, *Store Theme* and *blocks* are, in addition to learning how to customize your store’s pages by configuring *templates* and defining *styles*.

It's time to put your knowledge to the task and to practice by creating a store theme to call your own from scratch - block by block, style by style. Are you ready?

Access our [**hands-on course on VTEX Store Framework**](https://learn.vtex.com/page/learning-path-lang-en).

> ℹ️ If you've already completed the course and wish to move on to the next step of configuring your store theme, remember: up until the very last step of this track, the Store Theme app is stored in your local files and is linked to your VTEX store only through your Development workspace. To make these changes to your store's theme reach end users, you'll need to [make your theme content public](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-making-your-theme-content-public/).
