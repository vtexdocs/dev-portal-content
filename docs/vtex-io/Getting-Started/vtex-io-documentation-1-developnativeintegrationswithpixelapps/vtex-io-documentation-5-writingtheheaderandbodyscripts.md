Now, it is time to define the scripts that your Pixel app will run on the store website. You can specify scripts that execute inside the `<header>` and/or `<body>` tags.

Adding a script to the `<header>` ensures that it will be executed before any other HTML element is rendered on the page. Although this may affect store performance, it is a good option if your Pixel app relies on the interaction between users and store components. On the other hand, adding a script to the store `<body>` tag will probably reduce the impact on performance scores. However, this may come at the cost of losing user data. Choose wisely based on the functionality of your Pixel app.

## Instructions

1. Open the `pixel/header.html` file and replace the provided function with your own.

  > ℹ️ If you choose to execute your script inside the `<body>` tag, rename the `header.html` file to `body.html`.

2. Use the `settingsSchema` identification key previously defined where applicable. See the following example:

```html
<script>
  // Using via JavaScript
  var appId = "{{settings.gtmId}}";
</script>

<!-- Using directly in an HTML tag -->
<script src="//foobar.com?gtmId={{settings.gtmId}}"></script>
```
