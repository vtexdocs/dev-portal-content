VTEX IO is an open-source project. Contributions of all kinds are welcome, including feature requests, bug reports, and updates to our codebase and documentation.

## Codebase

VTEX IO native apps are fully stored in the [VTEX Apps Organization](https://github.com/vtex-apps) on <span class="fa fa-github"></span> GitHub.

That means you can contribute to our codebase by looking for the desired app on the VTEX Apps Organization and then [opening an issue](#opening-an-issue) or [creating a Pull Request.](#creating-a-pull-request)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è When looking for an app on the VTEX Apps Organization, keep in mind that the name of VTEX IO apps are [kebab case.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case) That means they are comprised of lowercase letters separated by hyphens. Therefore, if, for example, you want to contribute to the Product Summary app you must look for [`product-summary`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-summary) on the VTEX Apps Organization.

### Opening an issue

There are three main situations you should opt for opening an issue:

- Report a bug you can‚Äôt solve by yourself.
- Request a new feature or suggest an idea.
- Ask questions you had during development.

Once you open an issue, our team will evaluate your contribution as soon as possible.

#### Filtering issues

We use GitHub tags to classify issues between **Questions, Bugs or Enhancements.** This way, you can filter issues by specifying a label and author.

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/contributing-2.png)

You can also change the **sort criteria** for the issues. For example, you can look for the most and least commented issues, the ones with most üëç and most recently updated.

### Creating a Pull Request

We recommend creating a Pull Request for trivial fixes or if you have already started working on a specific solution.

To create a Pull Request, take the following steps:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the desired repository and create a local clone of it.
2. [Create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) from `master`, respecting the following name pattern: `<type>/<description>`, where `description` must provide a brief description of what is being developed and `type` must be one of the following:

- `feature` - new feature or behavior.
- `fix` - bug fix.
- `update` - dependecy update.
- `chore` - technical adjustments.

```sh
git checkout master
git checkout -b feature/nice-new-thing
```

3. Commit changes to your new branch.

```sh
git commit -m "Add nice new thing"
```

4. Test your changes.
5. [Create a Pull Request.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) Make sure to include screenshots and a comprehensive description of the changes performed.

Once you open a Pull Request, our team will evaluate your contribution as soon as possible.

## Documentation

There are three main ways to contribute to VTEX IO documentation:

- [Giving feedback](#giving-feedback) - start a discussion regarding a specific document and leave quick suggestions.
- [Creating a Pull Request](#creating-a-pull-request-1) - work directly on a solution for improving a specific document and create a Pull Request.
- [Writing new documentation](#writing-new-documentation) - keep up with our best practices and write the documentation of your custom app.

### Giving feedback

Fill out our [üì£ Feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmnotPvPjw-SjiE7lt2Nt3RQgNUe10ixXZmuO2v9enOJReoQ/viewform?entry.1972292648=developers.vtex.com&entry.1799503232=) and leave your suggestions on how we can improve a specific document.

Responses to the form are automatically added to our internal backlog and assigned to the team concerned. If you ask for a follow-up, we will let you know once we have addressed your feedback.

### Creating a Pull Request

All guides, references, and tutorials from the [VTEX IO Developer Documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/app-development) is fetched from the [`io-documentation`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/io-documentation) repository.

In its turn, the documentation of VTEX IO apps are fetched directly from its corresponding GitHub repository.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è App documentation is fetched only from apps using the Docs builder.

Therefore, you can create a Pull Request with your fixes directly on the [`io-documentation`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/io-documentation) repository or on the repository of the corresponding app you want to contribute (e.g., [`product-summary`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-summary))

### Writing new documentation

To make the documentation of your custom app public on the Developer Portal, you must take the following steps:

1. Create a `docs/` folder in the app‚Äôs root.
2. Update the app's `manifest.json` file to declare `vtex.docs` as one of the app's builders.

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/contributing-4.png)

3. Inside the `docs/` folder create a `README.md` file.

   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è When writing the documentation of your app, make sure to follow our [documentation templates.](#documentation-templates)

4. Contact us to make your documentation visible.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In order to not have to keep track of two `README.md` files (one in the project‚Äôs root and another it the `docs/` folder), you can delete the former and only keep the latter. GitHub will read the one from the `docs/` folder and render it on the landing page.

# APP NAME

<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-BADGE:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-0-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/docs/vtex-io/Hello/#contributors-)

Under the app's name, you should explain the topic, giving a **brief description** of its **functionality** in a store when installed.

Next, **add media** (either an image of a GIF) with the rendered components, so that users can better understand how the app works in practice.

![Media Placeholder](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/contributing-5.png)

## Configuration

In this section, you first must **add the primary instructions** that will allow users to use the app's blocks in their store, such as:

1. Adding the app as a theme dependency in the `manifest.json` file;
2. Declaring the app's main block in a given theme template or inside another block from the theme.

Remember to add a table with all blocks exported by the app and their descriptions. You can verify an example of it on the [Search Result documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-search-result/).

Next, add the **props table** containing your block's props.

If the app exports more than one block, create several tables - one for each block. For example:

### `block-1` props

| Prop name | Type     | Description | Default value |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `XXXXX`   | `XXXXXX` | XXXXXXXX    | `XXXXXX`      |

### `block-2` props

| Prop name | Type     | Description | Default value |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `XXXXX`   | `XXXXXX` | XXXXXXXX    | `XXXXXX`      |

Prop types are:

- `string`
- `enum`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `object`
- `array`

When documenting a prop whose type is `object` or `array` another prop table will be needed. You can create it following the example below:

- `propName` object:

| Prop name | Type     | Description | Default value |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `XXXXX`   | `XXXXXX` | XXXXXXXX    | `XXXXXX`      |

Remember to also use this Configuration section to **showcase any necessary disclaimer** related to the app and its blocks, such as the different behavior it may display during its configuration.

## Modus Operandi _(not mandatory)_

There are scenarios in which an app can behave differently in a store, according to how it was added to the catalog, for example. It's crucial to go through these **behavioral changes** in this section, allowing users to fully understand the **practical application** of the app in their store.

If you feel compelled to give further details about the app, such as it's **relationship with the VTEX admin**, don't hesitate to use this section.

## Customization

The first thing that should be present in this section is the sentence below, showing users the recipe pertaining to CSS customization in apps:

`In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-css-handles-for-store-customization).`

Thereafter, you should add a single column table with the available CSS handles for the app, like the one below. Note that the Handles must be ordered alphabetically.

| CSS Handles |
| ----------- |
| `XXXXX`     |
| `XXXXX`     |
| `XXXXX`     |
| `XXXXX`     |
| `XXXXX`     |

If there are none, add the following sentence instead:

`No CSS Handles are available yet for the app customization.`
