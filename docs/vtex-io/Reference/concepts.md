## [Billing Options](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-billing-options)

Configure your app's **billing options** to distribute your application in the VTEX ecosystem. Define an app’s distribution on the platform and structure its pricing data, allowing the application usage to be public and, in some scenarios, even charged.

## [Builders](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders)

Learn how to use **builders**. A VTEX IO abstraction that works as an API service responsible for processing and interpreting a directory in your app.

## [Clients](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients)

Create and configure **Clients** to abstract communications of a given system

## [CMS](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-cms)

Use the **CMS** to manage your storefront.

## [Dependencies](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-dependencies)

Declare **dependencies**in your app's *manifest* file to specify which VTEX IO apps your app relies on to properly work.

## [Edition App](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app)

An **Edition App**consists of a bundle of settings, policies, back-end and front-end apps encapsulated and exported by a *Sponsor Account.*

## [Interfaces](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-interface)

**Interface**is what links a block to a React component.

## [Manifest](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-manifest)

The `manifest.json` file is the first communication point with VTEX IO, holding important metadata about an app, such as its name, version, vendor, description, dependencies, etc.

## [Peer Dependencies](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-peerdependencies)

Declare **peer dependencies** in your app's *manifest* file to specify which VTEX IO apps that must not be automatically installed in an account your app relies on to properly work.

## [Policies](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-policies)

**Policies** are a set of permissions granted to a *resource* (VRN) or a *role* that allows or forbids them to execute a given set of actions in an account, such as performing a request to the platform.

## [Roles](ref:roles)

**Roles** are uniquely identifiable names given to request sources.

## [Routes](/docs/guides/routes)

A **route** maps a URL pattern and an HTTP request method to an action. It's, therefore, a way of setting the application expected behavior for client requests to specific endpoints. Check this concept to find out how VTEX IO handles routing.

## [Slots](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-slots)

**Slots** composition is a new way to declare a React component in your store theme code.

## [Sponsor Account](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-sponsor-account)

A **Sponsor Account**is a VTEX account responsible for the development and release of the *Edition App* installed in its child accounts.

## [VTEX IO CLI](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-toolbelt)

**VTEX IO CLI** is a command-line interface that gives you access to every feature of the VTEX platform.

## [VTEX Resource Name (VRN)](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vrn)

A **VTEX Resource Name (VRN)** is how the VTEX IO platform expresses the resource path called in a request.

## [Workspace](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspace)

**Workspaces** are work spaces isolated from one another.
